However, you may be surprised to learn that introverts make incredible nurses. There are several traits introverts possess that make them excellent candidates for a career in travel nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Introverted Travel Nurse Strengths\r\n\r\nOne of the many great qualities introverted travel nurses possess is that they are more likely to establish deep connections with other people. This is true of their relationships with patients, and with co-workers. Being able to establish trust with others is a perfect quality to have when caring for patients as a travel nurse! Part of this strength can be attributed to the strong listening skills a shy nurse has. This enables an introverted travel nurse an ability to make others feel like the most important person in the world. Introverted nurses can really make their patients feel special because of the trust they can create.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for a anyone working alongside an introverted travel nurse. Trust in large part on a team results from consistency in performance over time. Introverted nurses tend to listen and clearly understand expectations more often. That makes them a valuable trusted asset in any cost center they work in.\r\n\r\nIntroverts generally don\u2019t want to be the center of attention which also makes them great team players and incredibly diligent. An introverted travel nurse with observant tendencies can also be a great team member when it comes to conflict resolution as well. They are consistently great at keeping their cool in stressful situations. This dependency leads people to more often trust shy nurses, in some of the most difficult work scenarios.\r\n\r\nWith all these powerful traits in their character, it\u2019s easy to see why introverted travel nurses are in high demand for high paying travel nursing roles at hospital\u2019s, trauma centers, and travel nurse agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Some of the Challenges\r\n\r\nEvery one of these strengths has the potential to become a personal weakness, and there are some challenges introverted nurses will often run into as well.\r\n\r\nInitiating conversations can be a challenge for some introverted registered nurses, so it\u2019s important that they consciously recognize opportunities to interact in positive and trusting communication. Often times this will require that they push themselves out of their comfort zone to initiate a conversation with a patient, another member of the team, or a trusted third party.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an introverted nurse may get sucked into a conversation they don\u2019t want to be a part of, and not know how to politely end or exit the conversation. This can easily drain the emotional strength of a shy nurse. It\u2019s important for an introverted nurse to remain self aware and take \u201cquiet time\u201d for themselves in these scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n## An Introverted Summary\r\n\r\nBeing an introvert does not need to interfere with anyone becoming an incredible nurse. In many cases, being an introverted nurse provides the perfect skill set to accomplish and conquer. Being self aware and striving to help others in the best ways will help an introverted travel nurse build exceptional confidence over time. That confidence will carry over into travel nursing work, and relationships beyond your career!\r\n\r\n \n","html":"<p>For most people, it seems reasonable to believe that only very social and outgoing travel nurses would excel in temporary healthcare positions.

Staffing started in a tiny living room in Boise, Idaho as the part-time passion project of our founder, Jen. As a seasoned travel nurse, Jen was very familiar with how to take care of patients and wanted to take the same approach to helping other travel nurses find fulfillment in their career \u2013 wherever that road may take them.\r\n\r\nOver the years we\u2019ve grown \u2013 and although we\u2019re no longer operating in Jen\u2019s living room anymore- one thing hasn\u2019t changed. We care about every registered nurse on our team.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve worked diligently to ensure our level of \u201ccaring\u201d separates us and have no intent to change. We\u2019re all in the people business it turns out, and we love every minute of what we do for each and every nurse on our team.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve grown into a full RN\/BSN-based professional nursing\u00a0agency with locations in Idaho, Oregon and Utah and we operate nationally.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in both\u00a0per diem and travel nursing contracts for\u00a0experienced ED, ICU, OB, OR\/PACU, NICU, and MS nurses.\r\n\r\nSince 2004, we\u2019ve built up a significant pool of highly competent, flexible and reliable travel nurses. Our stability and growth over the years is a demonstration of the clinical competence and positive demeanor our nurses bring to every clinical setting.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re still writing our story one chapter at a time, and look forward to sharing a few pages of the journey with you.

As a seasoned travel nurse, Jen was very familiar with how to take care of patients and wanted to take the same approach to helping other travel nurses find fulfillment in their career &#8211; wherever that road may take them.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years we&#8217;ve grown &#8211; and although we&#8217;re no longer operating in Jen&#8217;s living room anymore- one thing hasn&#8217;t changed. We care about every registered nurse on our team.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve worked diligently to ensure our level of &#8220;caring&#8221; separates us and have no intent to change. We&#8217;re all in the people business it turns out, and we love every minute of what we do for each and every nurse on our team.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve grown into a full RN\/BSN-based professional nursing\u00a0agency with locations in Idaho, Oregon and Utah and we operate nationally.<\/p>\n<p>We specialize in both\u00a0per diem and travel nursing contracts for\u00a0experienced ED, ICU, OB, OR\/PACU, NICU, and MS nurses.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2004, we&#8217;ve built up a significant pool of highly competent, flexible and reliable travel nurses. Our stability and growth over the years is a demonstration of the clinical competence and positive demeanor our nurses bring to every clinical setting.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re still writing our story one chapter at a time, and look forward to sharing a few pages of the journey with you.

Most travel nurse requirements vary by geographic location, or facility family.\r\n\r\nYou may be surprised at how easy it is to start working in this exciting field. All of us at Elite Specialty Staffing are here to help make the change an easy transition.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are Travel Nurses Needed?\r\n\r\nTo begin, it may help to understand \u201cwhy\u201d hospitals, care centers and other healthcare facilities need travel nurses to assist with clinical care. For most of the last few decades, there has been an active shortage of registered staff nurses in most area\u2019s of the country. The shortage of nurses, causes hospitals and other healthcare facilities to actively seek short term outside help from highly skilled, nursing candidates to ensure the facility can continue to provide excellent on-going quality care to their patients. Travel nurses work with nursing staffing agencies, and other resources to help fill these shorter term gaps in a variety of clinical settings, and cost centers.\r\n\r\n### Travel Nursing Benefits\r\n\r\nBecause of the gaps created, which travel nurses fill, the first and foremost benefit of travel nursing, is knowing that you are filling a need for hospitals and patients! A need for highly skilled, quality nursing exists in every corner of the country, and globe. Due to those needs travel nurses are regularly able to choose where they want to work, which specialty they want to work in, and the length of time of their travel contract.\r\n\r\nTravel nurses are generally paid very well. [When compared with United States Department of Labor staff nurse wage averages](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/bls\/blswage.htm)\u00a0\u00a0a highly skilled travel nurse can expect higher paying \u201cregular time\u201d rates. Once acclimated to the differences in schedule and opportunity, experienced travel nurses receive some of the highest pay of all nurses in all 50 states. Experienced travel nurses are regularly in high demand.\r\n\r\nAnother outstanding benefit is that travel nurses regularly have their housing and travel costs covered. There are also distinct tax advantages for a travel nurse who travels more than 50 miles away from their home to work. Travel nurses can also receive a full benefits package as well. Available medical, dental, and vision healthcare along with 401(k) retirement benefits, paid time off and other deals or sponsored benefits make travel nursing an enticing opportunity to expand your skillset and experience.\r\n\r\nBonuses for starting a contract, continuing a contract, taking an assignment at a \u201chigh need\u201d facility,\u00a0 or fulfilling multiple contracts with a single staffing agency are also among the benefits that a travel nurse can expect.\r\n\r\nAnd they wouldn\u2019t call it \u201ctravel\u201d nursing without a purpose. At the root of the profession, being a travel nurse allows you an opportunity to see and explore the country or the world to the fullest. We think travel nursing is better than vacation though, because spending 3 months in each city that you take a contract in allows you to not only meet new friends but establish great relationships with those you meet. Exposure to different cultures, new and interesting foods, and local entertainment allows you to really get invested in the local community to learn and grow while you are on a contract assignment.\r\n\r\nBeing in a new location, with a new team also allows you as a travel nurse to gain valuable insights and skills from different healthcare delivery systems, and practices. Those new professional experiences will help you become a more independent, flexible, and experienced nurse.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, these are just some of the fantastic benefits that await you in a travel nursing career.\r\n\r\n### How a Travel Nurse is Made!\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll need to complete a couple basic steps before signing up for your first travel nursing contract. You must first attend a nursing school of your choice and earn at a minimum a degree as a registered nurse, or RN. Nursing school is no easy feat and can be incredibly competitive. It will require anywhere between a two to four year commitment depending on your program and your place of study.\r\n\r\nOnce you have triumphantly conquered a nursing program, you\u2019ll need to pass the [NCLEX-RN exam](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/nclex.htm).\u00a0As soon as you\u2019ve passed the exam, you\u2019ll need to work for a minimum of one year in a hospital or trauma center setting in the specialty which you wish to practice long term. A large majority of healthcare facilities will require that you have at a minimum an [Associate of Science in Nursning (ASN)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Associate_of_Science_in_Nursing) degree.While you can work as an RN with an associate\u2019s degree,\u00a0nurses\u00a0with a [Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)](https:\/\/www.allnursingschools.com\/bsn\/)\u00a0degree are typically given more responsibility, supervisory roles and higher pay. The same generally applies for travel nurses.\r\n\r\nDepending on the specialty you would like to focus your work in, there are a number of other certifications that may also be necessary to acquire, and maintain over time. At this point, when you\u2019ve got all that work accomplished and all that paperwork in order, you\u2019re ready to begin working with a travel nurse staffing company like [Elite Specialty Staffing](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/) to find your first travel contract and begin conquering the world as a travel nurse!\r\n\r\n### Your First Travel Nurse Contract\r\n\r\nAs you engage with a Nurse staffing company, and start to work with a nurse recruiter to help find your assignment, there are a couple of additional steps to keep in mind. Before you begin fulfilling travel nursing jobs, most agencies will also require you to share a resume, and updated medical records. You\u2019ll likely need to get a TB test, additional immunizations and complete additional skills testing and training in your specialty.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll then work through choosing the best contract with your nurse recruiter and the \u201ctravel\u201d transition will begin to feel more real!\u00a0Finding a job as a travel nurse is usually the easy part. With the demand for nurses so high, the best way to find a job, is to work with a staffing agency who can offer you multiple job opportunities at once to allow you to compare your options.\r\n\r\nMany travel nurse agencies offer benefits such as healthcare, housing, retirement, travel reimbursement, as mentioned above, so once you have selected where you want to work, you will be able to compare offers and interview at various locations and decide which position is best for you and your career.\r\n\r\nThere might not always be options in the specific city you choose but it is almost guaranteed that there will be plenty of options in the state you choose, so keep a slightly open mind when working through the assignment list. Occasionally working in another state means getting another state license, however your recruiter can help walk you through all of the specific details with each travel nursing job available to you. Ask your recruiter about [\u201ccompact RN licenses\u201d](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/11281.htm) which allow you to work in many states without obtaining that specific license.\r\n\r\nOnce you have selected the right contract for your first travel nursing assignment, the interview process will begin. Interviewing with a facility to fill a travel nursing need is much simpler than it is for a staff position. Usually a nurse manager from your staffing agency will interview you prior to jumping on with the facility. In most instances, the nurse staffing agency interview will suffice, but be open to a facility interview as well prior to beginning work at the facility.\r\n\r\nAfter those final interviews you\u2019ll be packing your bags and heading to your first high paying travel nursing assignment! Most travel nurse assignments last 13 weeks, and if you decide you don\u2019t like where you are working, your commitment will not extend beyond the length of the contract. If you do like your travel nursing job and location, many nurses are offered extensions at the end of their assignment.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is also an opportunity for you to decide if you want this position so write down specific questions you want to ask them, like how often they have travel nurses at their facility, what the cancellation policy is, if you will have to take call, and if there are opportunities for overtime.\r\n\r\n \n","html":"<p>While much is required to become a registered nurse, there is not much additional work beyond that to become a travel nurse. Most travel nurse requirements vary by geographic location, or facility family.<\/p>\n<p>You may be surprised at how easy it is to start working in this exciting field. All of us at Elite Specialty Staffing are here to help make the change an easy transition.<\/p>\n<h2>Why are Travel Nurses Needed?<\/h2>\n<p>To begin, it may help to understand \u201cwhy\u201d hospitals, care centers and other healthcare facilities need travel nurses to assist with clinical care. For most of the last few decades, there has been an active shortage of registered staff nurses in most area&#8217;s of the country. The shortage of nurses, causes hospitals and other healthcare facilities to actively seek short term outside help from highly skilled, nursing candidates to ensure the facility can continue to provide excellent on-going quality care to their patients. Travel nurses work with nursing staffing agencies, and other resources to help fill these shorter term gaps in a variety of clinical settings, and cost centers.<\/p>\n<h3>Travel Nursing Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>Because of the gaps created, which travel nurses fill, the first and foremost benefit of travel nursing, is knowing that you are filling a need for hospitals and patients! A need for highly skilled, quality nursing exists in every corner of the country, and globe. Due to those needs travel nurses are regularly able to choose where they want to work, which specialty they want to work in, and the length of time of their travel contract.<\/p>\n<p>Travel nurses are generally paid very well. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/bls\/blswage.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When compared with United States Department of Labor staff nurse wage averages<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0a highly skilled travel nurse can expect higher paying &#8220;regular time&#8221; rates. Once acclimated to the differences in schedule and opportunity, experienced travel nurses receive some of the highest pay of all nurses in all 50 states. Experienced travel nurses are regularly in high demand.<\/p>\n<p>Another outstanding benefit is that travel nurses regularly have their housing and travel costs covered. There are also distinct tax advantages for a travel nurse who travels more than 50 miles away from their home to work. Travel nurses can also receive a full benefits package as well. Available medical, dental, and vision healthcare along with 401(k) retirement benefits, paid time off and other deals or sponsored benefits make travel nursing an enticing opportunity to expand your skillset and experience.<\/p>\n<p>Bonuses for starting a contract, continuing a contract, taking an assignment at a &#8220;high need&#8221; facility,\u00a0 or fulfilling multiple contracts with a single staffing agency are also among the benefits that a travel nurse can expect.<\/p>\n<p>And they wouldn&#8217;t call it &#8220;travel&#8221; nursing without a purpose. At the root of the profession, being a travel nurse allows you an opportunity to see and explore the country or the world to the fullest. We think travel nursing is better than vacation though, because spending 3 months in each city that you take a contract in allows you to not only meet new friends but establish great relationships with those you meet. Exposure to different cultures, new and interesting foods, and local entertainment allows you to really get invested in the local community to learn and grow while you are on a contract assignment.<\/p>\n<p>Being in a new location, with a new team also allows you as a travel nurse to gain valuable insights and skills from different healthcare delivery systems, and practices. Those new professional experiences will help you become a more independent, flexible, and experienced nurse.<\/p>\n<p>All things considered, these are just some of the fantastic benefits that await you in a travel nursing career.<\/p>\n<h3>How a Travel Nurse is Made!<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to complete a couple basic steps before signing up for your first travel nursing contract. You must first attend a nursing school of your choice and earn at a minimum a degree as a registered nurse, or RN. Nursing school is no easy feat and can be incredibly competitive. It will require anywhere between a two to four year commitment depending on your program and your place of study.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have triumphantly conquered a nursing program, you&#8217;ll need to pass the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/nclex.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NCLEX-RN exam<\/a>.\u00a0As soon as you&#8217;ve passed the exam, you&#8217;ll need to work for a minimum of one year in a hospital or trauma center setting in the specialty which you wish to practice long term. A large majority of healthcare facilities will require that you have at a minimum an <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Associate_of_Science_in_Nursing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Associate of Science in Nursning (ASN)<\/a> degree.While you can work as an RN with an associate&#8217;s degree,\u00a0nurses\u00a0with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allnursingschools.com\/bsn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)<\/a>\u00a0degree are typically given more responsibility, supervisory roles and higher pay.

And what\u2019s the average travel nurse salary? Well, the average travel nurse salary is higher paying than a staff nurse salary. On top of that, the benefits of travel nursing include paid housing, tax deductions, excellent healthcare coverage and bonus opportunities. Not bad, is it?!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Paid Housing\r\n\r\nIf you want to do travel nursing, housing isn\u2019t a problem, as paid housing is usually included as part of the travel nurse assignment. Some travel nurse agencies, like [Elite Specialty Staffing](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/), even offer additional benefits like utilities, food, and mileage reimbursements on top of the travel nurse salary! If you do not want paid housing, you can usually opt for a stipend instead.\r\n\r\nAs rents are skyrocketing and mortgages and cost of living increases are never fun to consider regardless of the economy, a job where paid housing is included in the deal isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. If you already have a rental, or own a house, in your hometown, you can easily rent it out while you go on a travel nursing assignment. Thanks to companies like [airbnb.com](https:\/\/airbnb.com) becoming successful worldwide, property management companies have propped up everywhere, so finding someone to look after and rent out your property while you are traveling won\u2019t be a problem at all. It can even allow you to further increase the amount of money you take home with that additional stream of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bonus Opportunities\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the travel nurse pay scale you have to bear in mind, not just the salary, but the many bonuses that are often offered as well \u2014 some agencies offer sign-on bonuses, others completion bonuses, and there is always a fair bit to be made in overtime pay or with holiday pay. There are also referral bonuses available in many cases, so that if you refer a friend to work for the same travel nursing agency, you get a bonus.\r\n\r\nThe amount offered in bonuses vary greatly, but it can be significant amounts, even up to $5,000 if a geographical area, or a specific hospital or trauma center has a shortage of nurses. Where nurses are in high demand, you\u2019ll generally find the greatest rewards.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in many cases completion bonuses are often dependent on you fulfilling the entire contract without missing a single hour of work. There may also be deductions, as the recruitment agency will have to pay certain fees once they receive the bonuses from the hospitals. As with anything else, read the fine print and you\u2019ll be able to competently receive the high paying salary and most needed benefits for your personal situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## You\u2019re Paid to Travel\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve always dreamed of traveling, being a travel nurse is a great way to expand your career, and see all 50 states or even the world! Travel nurse jobs provide everything you need \u2014 including a paycheck. Not only that, as was mentioned before you\u2019re actually reimbursed for your travel costs as well. If not, at least you can get tax deductions for your travel costs.\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse you also travel differently from the average tourist.\u00a0 As a tourist you\u2019re likely only to stay for a few days, or a week. As someone who is working, you get to stay longer and you naturally meet locals at work. You can explore a new location or area beyond what the tourists see. Which is really what travel nursing is all about, the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tax Deductions\r\n\r\nBeing a travel nurse, tax deductions are part of the deal. Things like travel stipends, free housing, meal stipends, etc. are not usually taxed. And if you have to pay for travel and other expenses related to your travel nursing assignment, chances are you get tax deductions for them. If you are uncertain about what counts as a tax deduction, what doesn\u2019t, and what you have to tax for and what you don\u2019t, consult an accountant. There are many accountants that focus only on the needs of travel nurses specifically. We strongly recommend, and trust the entire [Travel Tax](http:\/\/www.traveltax.com\/) team. Contact them today to learn more about how to tackle the taxes associated with a travel nursing career.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Health Insurance\r\n\r\nFree housing and tax deductions aren\u2019t the only perks of short term travel nursing \u2014 you also get health insurance in most cases. The typical travel nursing health benefits include medical, dental and vision. So no need to drag your heels about getting new specs, or getting rid of those wisdom teeth!\r\n\r\nHaving medical insurance taken care of can be a great saving. Just make sure you compare what\u2019s included in the insurance deal when comparing one travel nurse salary to another. We all know that not all health insurances are created equal, and everyone\u2019s personal needs are different.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Salary Expectations for Travel Nurses\r\n\r\nBenefits aside, what is and actual travel nurse salary for a registered nurse? Travel nursing pay is great. The travel nurse pay-scale varies, depending on where you choose to work (salaries vary by region) and your nursing specialty. The more experience you have, the better the pay. Also, it\u2019s dependent on the type of assignment you choose. Across the board though, the pay is better than a similar position for a staff nurse at the same facility.\r\n\r\nAnnual travel nursing salaries also depends on your flexibility when it comes to filling available assignments. If you are willing to go where the pay is good, then you\u2019re likely to earn more, than if you have a set destination in mind (unless that destination always has well-paid assignments available). And, covering strikes is usually the best way of getting a high travel nurse salary, no matter what your field or specialty.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that if you own a home somewhere, or have other forms of passive income, this will affect your taxes, which will, in turn, affect your earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 401K\r\n\r\nWorried about your retirement plan? You don\u2019t have to. Most travel nursing companies offer retirement plans, so be sure to choose one which does! Many of them will also match your contributions. Meaning your travel nurse salary isn\u2019t just better \u2014 your retirement plan might be too.\r\n\r\n \n","html":"<p>What are the benefits travel nursing?

Looking to try a travel nurse job? Or have you tentatively thought about a travel nursing career, but aren\u2019t quite sure? Maybe you\u2019re too busy living life at the moment?\r\n\r\nSuccessful travel nursing positions can take time to find. That means it\u2019s time to start thinking about the year ahead. What will your career goals be for 2019? How can an [Elite Specialty Staffing](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/)\u00a0Advocate help you in that job search?\r\n\r\nRight now, travel nurse assignments across the country are opening up for the first few part of 2019. If you\u2019re contemplating becoming a travel nurse, now\u2019s the time to take the leap. Why choose travel nursing? There are plenty of reasons to be a travel nurse, here are nine to get you started!\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Competitive Pay**\r\n\r\nPersonal happiness is the number one reason for doing anything career-wise, but money usually comes in as a close second! A career as a travel nurse thankfully offers high paying wages.\r\n\r\nFor travel nurse who would rather stay close to home, The hourly rates on travel contracts are better than being a staff nurse and most jobs offer shift differentials, overtime, and holiday pay too. This is in addition to a benefits package and other perks, such as housing stipends, referral bonuses (when you refer friends), completion bonuses, sign-on bonuses and so forth.\r\n\r\nTo be a travel nurse is, frankly, quite lucrative. You just have to find the right travel nurse staffing agency to help you fill travel RN jobs that pay the best and offer the best perks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Open the Door to Endless Opportunities**\r\n\r\nWhile registered nurses are always in demand, there are locations that have more nursing shortages than others, just like locations that offer better pay than others. When you choose a career as a travel nurse, you open the door to assignments all across the country. There\u2019s no longer the need to wait for \u201cthe perfect opening\u201d.\r\n\r\nYou will have access to plenty of perfect openings all across the country! As a registered nurse, you never need to be out of work again when you choose to be a travel nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Gain Experience**\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to gain experience in a new nursing specialty, or improve existing skills, you can find the perfect job to do just that! Rather than waiting for an opening near where you\u2019re located, you can go away, gain expertise and come back with the resum\u00e9 you need to land the jobs you truly want.\r\n\r\nAnd if you always dreamed of working in a hospital in the big city, or working in a rural town in the middle of nowhere, now\u2019s the chance to do it. You can start traveling to explore the places you\u2019ve always dreamed of seeing and get paid higher wages to do it.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, no matter what assignment you choose, you will grow professionally and gain confidence, as well as experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Get Rid of Rental and Mortgage Payments**\r\n\r\nPaying rent, or a mortgage, is never fun and a travel nursing career can help with paying them for you. Most travel nursing companies pay a stipend for housing, or provide housing as part of the contract. That means you can give up your current rental, or rent out your home.\r\n\r\nThis perk alone incites many nurses to choose travel nursing for a year, or two, to help them fulfill their patient care goals and enjoy their time away.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Discover New Places**\r\n\r\nFor those who suffer from wanderlust, travel nursing is an excellent option. Not only do you get to see as many new places as you like \u2014 you get paid doing so. Working in a city also allows you to get to know it in an entirely different way than when just stopping by. If you\u2019re considering finding a new place to settle down, it\u2019s a great way to take the pulse.\r\n\r\nThanks to digital nomads and more people moving cities, organizations like [meetup.com](http:\/\/meetup.com) and [InterNations.com](http:\/\/InterNations.com) have popped up and will allow you to attend events where you can meet new people from all over the world. So you don\u2019t have to fear being lonely either.\r\n\r\nNurses working when traveling may seem counterintuitive, as you\u2019ll have less time off. In the thirteen weeks you normally spend on a travel nursing assignment, you will have plenty of days off to explore all the museums and hot spots you would in a one-week touristy visit. Chances are you will find a lot more places locals enjoy this way as well. You\u2019ll make many more friends amongst locals than the average tourist.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Avoid Workplace Drama**\r\n\r\nOne of the travel nursing benefits has nothing to do with better pay, or free healthcare. No, it\u2019s simply the ability to avoid workplace drama.\r\n\r\nSooner or later in all clinical settings, we encounter co-workers, managers or team members that we just don\u2019t jive with. Being a travel nurse does not exclude you from these encounters. It does however give you more options to work through these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe difference? You don\u2019t need to get involved in hospital politics as you\u2019re a short term resource. And should you happen to come across a real humdinger, you can at least relax knowing you don\u2019t have to deal with them for long! When you have a permanent placement as a staff nurse, this is very different as you\u2019re stuck with the same people and are more likely to get involved.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, when you choose to be a travel nurse you always have the support of the staffing agency that arranged your placement. Great travel nursing agencies will have dedicated advocates to help you work through any of the scenario\u2019s you encounter. This, sadly, is something that\u2019s often lacking when you work directly for a trauma center or facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Flexibility and Freedom**\r\n\r\nAs pay is better when you choose to be a travel nurse, you can afford to take time off in-between assignments. If you want to go home and visit your family, or fly to Honolulu for a week, that\u2019s suddenly possible, because you\u2019re not tied down to a mere two weeks of vacation per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Avoid Burnout**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, you can afford to take time off. You also have the ability to leave an assignment after a few weeks, so if you don\u2019t like something, you\u2019re not stuck working until you break. When you choose to be a travel nurse you simply have the option to change jobs, or take time off, more often.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Discover New Hobbies, Make New Friends and See Yourself in a New Light**\r\n\r\nWe all need a change of scenery sometimes. By going to new places, we don\u2019t only get a change of scenery, we also tend to try new things, find new hobbies and discover ourselves in new ways. What\u2019s more, we meet people and make new friends who enable us to see the world in a new light.\r\n\r\nIt might sound corny, but we believe it makes us more informed and empathetic nurses. Traveling really does change your life and that\u2019s why many registered nurses choose to be travel nurses.\r\n\r\n[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section] \n","html":"\n[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22&#8243;][et_pb_row admin_label=&#8221;row&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.0.74&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;]<p>Do you want to be a travel nurse? Looking to try a travel nurse job? Or have you tentatively thought about a travel nursing career, but aren&#8217;t quite sure? Maybe you&#8217;re too busy living life at the moment?<\/p>\n<p>Successful travel nursing positions can take time to find. That means it&#8217;s time to start thinking about the year ahead. What will your career goals be for 2019? How can an <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/\">Elite Specialty Staffing<\/a>\u00a0Advocate help you in that job search?<\/p>\n<p>Right now, travel nurse assignments across the country are opening up for the first few part of 2019. If you\u2019re contemplating becoming a travel nurse, now\u2019s the time to take the leap. Why choose travel nursing? There are plenty of reasons to be a travel nurse, here are nine to get you started!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Competitive Pay<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Personal happiness is the number one reason for doing anything career-wise, but money usually comes in as a close second! A career as a travel nurse thankfully offers high paying wages.<\/p>\n<p>For travel nurse who would rather stay close to home, The hourly rates on travel contracts are better than being a staff nurse and most jobs offer shift differentials, overtime, and holiday pay too. This is in addition to a benefits package and other perks, such as housing stipends, referral bonuses (when you refer friends), completion bonuses, sign-on bonuses and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>To be a travel nurse is, frankly, quite lucrative. You just have to find the right travel nurse staffing agency to help you fill travel RN jobs that pay the best and offer the best perks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Open the Door to Endless Opportunities<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While registered nurses are always in demand, there are locations that have more nursing shortages than others, just like locations that offer better pay than others. When you choose a career as a travel nurse, you open the door to assignments all across the country. There\u2019s no longer the need to wait for \u201cthe perfect opening\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>You will have access to plenty of perfect openings all across the country! As a registered nurse, you never need to be out of work again when you choose to be a travel nurse.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gain Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you are looking to gain experience in a new nursing specialty, or improve existing skills, you can find the perfect job to do just that! Rather than waiting for an opening near where you&#8217;re located, you can go away, gain expertise and come back with the resum\u00e9 you need to land the jobs you truly want.<\/p>\n<p>And if you always dreamed of working in a hospital in the big city, or working in a rural town in the middle of nowhere, now\u2019s the chance to do it. You can start traveling to explore the places you&#8217;ve always dreamed of seeing and get paid higher wages to do it.<\/p>\n<p>One thing is for sure, no matter what assignment you choose, you will grow professionally and gain confidence, as well as experience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get Rid of Rental and Mortgage Payments<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Paying rent, or a mortgage, is never fun and a travel nursing career can help with paying them for you. Most travel nursing companies pay a stipend for housing, or provide housing as part of the contract. That means you can give up your current rental, or rent out your home.<\/p>\n<p>This perk alone incites many nurses to choose travel nursing for a year, or two, to help them fulfill their patient care goals and enjoy their time away.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Discover New Places<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For those who suffer from wanderlust, travel nursing is an excellent option. Not only do you get to see as many new places as you like \u2014 you get paid doing so. Working in a city also allows you to get to know it in an entirely different way than when just stopping by. If you\u2019re considering finding a new place to settle down, it\u2019s a great way to take the pulse.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to digital nomads and more people moving cities, organizations like <a href=\"http:\/\/meetup.com\">meetup.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/InterNations.com\">InterNations.com<\/a> have popped up and will allow you to attend events where you can meet new people from all over the world. So you don&#8217;t have to fear being lonely either.<\/p>\n<p>Nurses working when traveling may seem counterintuitive, as you\u2019ll have less time off. In the thirteen weeks you normally spend on a travel nursing assignment, you will have plenty of days off to explore all the museums and hot spots you would in a one-week touristy visit. Chances are you will find a lot more places locals enjoy this way as well. You\u2019ll make many more friends amongst locals than the average tourist.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Avoid Workplace Drama<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the travel nursing benefits has nothing to do with better pay, or free healthcare. No, it\u2019s simply the ability to avoid workplace drama.<\/p>\n<p>Sooner or later in all clinical settings, we encounter co-workers, managers or team members that we just don&#8217;t jive with. Being a travel nurse does not exclude you from these encounters. It does however give you more options to work through these scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>The difference? You don\u2019t need to get involved in hospital politics as you\u2019re a short term resource. And should you happen to come across a real humdinger, you can at least relax knowing you don\u2019t have to deal with them for long! When you have a permanent placement as a staff nurse, this is very different as you\u2019re stuck with the same people and are more likely to get involved.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, when you choose to be a travel nurse you always have the support of the staffing agency that arranged your placement. Great travel nursing agencies will have dedicated advocates to help you work through any of the scenario&#8217;s you encounter. This, sadly, is something that\u2019s often lacking when you work directly for a trauma center or facility.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Flexibility and Freedom<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As pay is better when you choose to be a travel nurse, you can afford to take time off in-between assignments.

That might mean starting out in a city that isn\u2019t in your top five, but the job in that city can help you gain the skills you need for a job that is.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to work in the ICU deep in the heart of Manhattan, but only have experience working in small rural hospitals, going straight for New York City is probably not be the best idea.

I don\u2019t care if you have an Associate\u2019s, Bachelor\u2019s, or Master\u2019s degree as a nurse \u2013 your skills are needed at healthcare facilities across the nation.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that the United States is experiencing a drastic shortage of nurses. When it comes to the travel sector, this need is compounded! With that comes a wave of opportunity. Consider the following about working as a travel nurse:\r\n\r\n- You can be selective when choosing your assignments.\r\n- Once you have a couple of contracts under your belt, you will have your pick of almost any assignment you want.\r\n- You can take advantage of your time off in between contracts to relax, decompress, or visit loved ones before your next job.\r\n- While working as a travel nurse, you will never be without a job as the opportunities are literally endless.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #3. Registered Nurses who Travel Gain Experience Like Crazy\r\n\r\nProfessional growth occurs at a sped up rate as a travel nurse. You will gain confidence to take on future assignments.\r\n\r\nYou can learn a lot in 13 weeks (which is the standard length of a travel contract). In fact, it\u2019s expected of you. As a staff nurse, you might be given a week or even a month to take classes and learn the hospital\u2019s electronic medical records (EMR) and computerized systems to process orders, distribute meds, etc.\r\n\r\nIn a career as a travel nurse, you will be given a crash course, usually eight hours or less, to learn the hospital\u2019s charting system and electronic tools. In fact, every single mandatory policy and procedure will also be delivered in a rushed fashion in order to get you working as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #4. Ease the Burden of Cost-of-Living Expenses\r\n\r\nHeat. Electric. Rent. Ugh, who has time for that?\r\n\r\nThe typical expenses for cost-of-living anywhere in the states can stack up to an amount comparable to your monthly salary! Rent and mortgages are at ridiculous levels as they peak at all-time highs, which makes 2019 a great year to choose travel nursing in order to lessen the burden of living expenses.\r\n\r\nTravel companies pay for housing expenses, including rent. If you decide to save money by taking the housing stipend, you can then use the extra cash towards your mortgage or alternative housing cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #5. Get Paid to Discover New Places\r\n\r\nIf your spirit longs for adventure, travel nursing might be your calling. What wanderlust wouldn\u2019t love to get paid to explore?\r\n\r\nWhen considering travel nursing assignments, check out opportunities in locations in which you\u2019ve always wanted to visit.\r\n\r\nDuring your assignment, don\u2019t be afraid to get out and take on the role of a tourist while you\u2019re in the area. Visit museums and parks, get tickets to local plays or movies and do some sightseeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #6. Bypass Workplace Drama\r\n\r\nCrabby managers. Bossy nurses. A few bad apples can make your nursing job more stressful than it has to be.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard the phrase \u201cfamiliarity breeds contempt\u201d?\r\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s true.\r\n\r\nNo matter how chill you are. How relaxed you are. It\u2019s inevitable. When you stay at a particular place of work for an extended period, you will be affected by the drama in the workplace. Even if the drama doesn\u2019t involve you, still, you will find yourself immersed in the stories and rants coming from the nurses who are.\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse, you have the option to stay more reserved and distance yourself from such negativity. Plus, if you encounter bumps along the road, it\u2019s easy to stay separate by reminding yourself that the position is only temporary!\r\n\r\nThree months is just enough time to get comfortable, but not too comfortable. You will be so busy learning your flow and executing care like a pro (because you are), you won\u2019t have the time or patience to get caught up in the drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #7. Freedom and Flexibility with Security\r\n\r\nTrue beauty lies in having a job that is rewarding that doesn\u2019t tie you down. Sometimes freedom and flexibility come with a price of performing work that is not guaranteed or in an industry with poor job security.\r\n\r\nWorking as a travel nurse is the perfect way to be more autonomous in deciding on what you want and what you\u2019re willing to negotiate on. You are left to call the shots.\r\n\r\nDo you want to take time off in between assignments? You can. Plan your work around the times you want off for the year. Extend your contract? Move to a new location? Whether you want to explore several locations in one year or stay based in a particular state or city, travel nursing can make this a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #8. Avoid Job Burnout\r\n\r\nTaking on various roles is inevitable in travel nursing. However, it\u2019s a plus that you only stay at each one only long enough to get paid well and avoid the burnout that comes with familiarity and repetition. Nursing burnout is real and it can be damaging. Switching up your assignment every few weeks helps avoid this.\r\n\r\nAs difficult as any nursing job, travel nursing work offers a total change up of scenery and co-workers, which can help keep your motivation up and your smile real.\r\n\r\n\r\n## #9. Grow. Evolve. Change.\r\n\r\nA travel nursing career provides a unique way to rediscover oneself. Make new friends. Discover new hobbies. Experiencing new locations and environments creates opportunities to try different things and meet people. Who knows. You might realize there\u2019s an entire world of things you love to do, you never even knew about.\r\n\r\nWhile working as a travel nurse, cultural growth is inevitable, as intertwining with the local people and environment will be your everyday life for as long as the contract lasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ready to be a travel nurse in 2019?\r\n\r\nFind the job that calls your name.

Travel nursing is an exciting career path that is brimming with elements guaranteed to spawn personal and professional growth.\r\n\r\nAre you still browsing travel nursing contracts, deciding on whether or not to take the plunge? Maybe you\u2019ve already passed this stage and have accepted an assignment. No matter where you fall on the continuum, these seven tips will help you prepare for your first travel nursing job.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 7 Tips for a First-Time Travel Nurse\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n### **1. Get organized \u2013 Stay organized**\r\n\r\nWhether you are simply exploring the job opportunities and submitting your resume or preparing to start your first travel nurse assignment \u2013 impeccable organization will help you keep track of your contacts and itinerary! Do all of the following preferably *before* you even start to look at jobs so that you are ready to put in for the ones you want the most.\r\n\r\n- Make sure your nurse licensure is up-to-date.\r\n- Obtain any additional licensing needed for the area in which you want to work (in advance when possible).\r\n- Be sure your health certificates for your physical exam, PPD test, and immunization records\/exemptions are current (the physical exam and PPD test must be within one year of the contract date).\r\n- Have current cards that are good for at least another six months for BLS, ALS, PALS or other additional certifications ready to go.\r\n- Have contact information for two clinical references who were supervisors or managers. Your options include: - a performance evaluation;\r\n- a written letter; or\r\n- contact details.\r\n- Have a high-resolution current image with a\u00a0white background on file.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n### **2. Be Open-Minded**\r\n\r\nSome travel nursing companies will market the lie that a first-time travel nurse can be placed on any assignment they want. Opportunities abound \u2013 do not get me wrong. However, for your first job as a travel nurse, you might have to choose a second or third-choice assignment. Stay calm. Be flexible. Location. Setting. Facility. Pay. Keep your mind open to negotiations and hear out your options. Once you have some experience under your belt, you can be pickier about the travel nursing jobs you choose.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n### **3. Consider seeking an assignment in a location familiar to you**\r\n\r\nStarting out in a whole new work setting with a new set of coworkers, policies, and situations comes with its own stressors. You might want to pick a location of comfort. A destination you\u2019ve visited before. Or perhaps there are places you could choose where you have friends or family members. Being a bit familiar or having a \u201chome base\u201d in a new location is a great way to calm your nerves and help you prepare for your first day as a travel nurse.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n### **4. Try not to take anything personally**\r\n\r\nTravel nursing is a stressful job that is fast-paced and filled with impactful and often critical decisions regarding the health of others. If you encounter any negative feedback from a patient you care for or a family member, listen to them. But. Do not. I repeat, *do not* take it personally. Be sure that you report anything said to your supervisor in order to find out what, if anything, there is that you need to do.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n### **5. Arrive early on day one and know where you are going**\r\n\r\nMany factors contribute to the length and ease of a commute to work. Furthermore, depending on what the facility is like, just finding out where to park and how to get to your respected setting in the building may pose other potential challenges. If possible, conduct a practice run the day before you start your travel nursing assignment. Drive to the facility at the respected time of your shift and find how to get to your floor. Use this \u201ctest run\u201d to help you determine if you are going to need more or less time to make it to work early (at least\u00a0by 15 minutes) on your first day at your travel nursing job.\r\n\r\n### **6. Ensure your home maintenance needs are covered.**\r\n\r\nGoing away for a travel nursing position when you already have a home base (which is common for many travelers) poses a unique set of circumstances. How will you handle your mail? Is it going to be forwarded to your new address? Will you put the mail on hold altogether? How about your home heating and cooling? Cancel it? Many big questions need to be considered and you need a road map as to how you\u2019re going to manage your home affairs from a different location.\r\n\r\n### **7. Don\u2019t bring everything, including the kitchen sink, with you!**\r\n\r\nMost travel nursing assignments are only 13 weeks in length. When packing for this time, really try to narrow it down to the essentials. Do you really need to bring all those shoes? Many small non-essential items can be bought at your new location.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Want to Find the Right Travel Nursing Job for You?\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re in the right place!

Tax deductions. Bonus opportunities. Excellent healthcare coverage. Even if you are not a travel nurse currently, you\u2019ve probably heard about the enticing travel nursing benefits and pay packages.\r\n\r\nWhat are they exactly? Keep reading to find out the typical incentives for travel nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Paid Housing for Travel Nurses\r\n\r\nHousing costs are through the roof. According to a [study](http:\/\/www.jchs.harvard.edu\/blog\/price-to-income-ratios-are-nearing-historic-highs\/) from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the price of sale for a single-family home as of 2017 was 4.2 times greater than the average annual household income. Taking a look at this ratio, it\u2019s easy to see why so many nurses find the paid housing a tempting reason to start traveling.\r\n\r\nWhen working as a travel nurse, your agency will most often pay for your housing or living expenses. This benefit is standard for most travel nurse compensation packages. A lot of health facilities now offer living quarters that are off-campus and designed for visiting or temporary staff to stay in free of charge. When these options are available, a travel nurse might be able to take the stipend for their own housing costs and still pocket extra cash.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget that housing expenses span more than simply rent. Oftentimes travel nursing agencies will also cover the cost of utilities!

However you package it, the fact is that nurses who travel are often paid a portion of tax-free money. According to the IRS guidelines, if you are traveling away from your residence for work, you are entitled to receive reimbursements which are non-taxable.\r\n\r\nWhen you work as a travel nurse, you can receive stipends taxed-free which usually include:\r\n\r\n- \u201cMeals and incidentals\u201d (incidentals includes things such as parking, bus fare, gas costs, and tips)\r\n- Housing or lodging\r\n- Travel expenses (the cost of getting to and from each assignment)\r\n- Housing stipends\r\n\r\nOther items may also be exempt from taxes including license reimbursements, health insurance, and retirement plans.\r\n\r\nWhat does a typical travel nurse tax advantage plan look like? Basically, you are taxed only on a blended rate of the minimum taxable wage, such as $20 per hour. The non-taxable reimbursements and stipends are added into the deal to give you a higher hourly rate. See the following example pay package:\r\n\r\n- $21 per hour \u2013 base pay rate which is reported to the IRS and taxed\r\n- $300 per week \u2013 non-taxable pay for meals and incidentals\r\n- $2,500 per month \u2013 non-taxable pay for housing or lodging expenses\r\n- $500 \u2013 non-taxable pay for the travel expenses of the assignment\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the above is simply an example, and each agency will have their own rates and incentives dependent on many factors such as the employer, the specialty, the location, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Travel Nursing Health Insurance\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the[ Affordable Care Act mandates that individuals carry health insurance or a pay a penalty](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/fees\/fee-for-not-being-covered\/).

You can also discuss receiving a stipend for the insurance options if you prefer to maintain your own policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Travel Nursing Salary\r\n\r\nRegistered nurses who work full-time at staff positions at healthcare facilities throughout the United States typically earn an average wage of $69,110 annually according to [The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/healthcare\/registered-nurses.htm). Other sites such as [Payscale](https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/research\/US\/Job=Travel_Nurse_(RN)\/Hourly_Rate), report that travel nurses can make six-figure annual incomes.\r\n\r\nRegardless, as a registered nurse, you are going to make more at a travel position than you would at a full-time staff nursing job.

Your potential income is dependent on many factors, such as:\r\n\r\n- The location of your travel nursing contract\r\n- Your nursing specialty\r\n- What type of assignment you take (keep in mind that contracts for rapid response, strikes, etc. pay more)\r\n- How flexible you are in choosing assignments\r\n- Your personal factors, such as whether you maintain a home elsewhere or whether you travel solo or with family, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Travel Nursing Retirement Plans and 401K\r\n\r\nDo you have a 401K retirement plan?

Taking a look at this ratio, it&#8217;s easy to see why so many nurses find the paid housing a tempting reason to start traveling.<\/p>\n<p>When working as a travel nurse, your agency will most often pay for your housing or living expenses. This benefit is standard for most travel nurse compensation packages. A lot of health facilities now offer living quarters that are off-campus and designed for visiting or temporary staff to stay in free of charge. When these options are available, a travel nurse might be able to take the stipend for their own housing costs and still pocket extra cash.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that housing expenses span more than simply rent.

Guide. Confidant. Your travel nurse recruiter is going to be your greatest resource while searching for and completing travel nursing jobs. In fact, the truth is that your entire assignment could be miserable if you end up with a bad recruiter. In contrast, an amazing recruiter could help you fulfill your dream nursing job.\r\n\r\nChoose wisely.\r\n\r\nA travel nursing recruiter\u2019s job extends beyond just you and your work, but also into your housing, your transportation, your money for food and other incidentals while on assignment, etc. In effect, they are there to support you in more ways besides just schedules and paychecks.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a first-time travel nurse or a seasoned vet, follow these five tips to choose a great travel nurse recruiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5 Tips for Landing a Rockstar Travel Nurse Recruiter\r\n\r\nEasing the worries of a first-time travel nurse. Taking on the stressors so the travel nurse can concentrate on their work. Use these five tips when searching for a knock-out recruiter that\u2019s going to do their best to ensure a smooth 13-week assignment:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##### **Great nursing recruiters often follow similar sets of patterns and have common behaviors and experiences.**\r\n\r\nWhen speaking with travel nursing recruiters, pay attention to how they act and watch for the following signs of a rockstar travel nurse recruiter:\r\n\r\n1. They\u2019ve worked with many travelers before.\r\n2. They\u2019re courteous with their time and do their best to answer all your questions.\r\n3. They are in your corner, even when no solution can be reached. They still support you and do everything possible for your best interest.\r\n4. A good travel nursing recruiter will make themself available for your needs beyond the hours they are in the office, even if it\u2019s just a text message reply.\r\n5. They are responsive and never leave their travel nurses without a reply for more than 48 hours.\r\n6. \u00a0A sign of a great recruiter is that they maintain organization and ensure your necessary medical documents and certifications have been submitted well in advance. Good recruiters do not surprise you at the last minute about missing documentation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##### **Watch out for any of the following red flags or warning signs that a staffer from a travel nursing company might not have your best interest in mind:**\r\n\r\n1. They make false promises that are not stated anywhere in your contract or documentation. This one is a *huge* red flag.\r\n2. They refuse to disclose all the details about pay until a contract is signed. Without exception, you should receive every last aspect of your pay package up front, in writing.\r\n3. They don\u2019t encourage you to take time to read a contract before accepting an assignment. You should always take a couple of days to review a contract and it\u2019s good to have someone you trust review it too. A nurse recruiter who is pressuring you to sign a contract quickly might have their interest above yours.\r\n4. When you get responses from them, they always sound scripted. If your nurse recruiter sounds like a robot, this could be a red flag that they lack experience.\r\n5. They disappear once you start the assignment. Some travel nurses prefer this type of interaction, but a good recruiter will make the effort to still check in about once a week or so to see how things are going.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##### **Know exactly what you want out of a travel nursing assignment.**\r\n\r\nBefore searching travel nursing companies to find the right recruiter, be sure you have a good idea of what it is you\u2019re looking for in an assignment, specifically in terms of location, pay packages, shift, benefits, cancellation policies, and specialty. Keep these terms relative and decide for yourself which of these you\u2019re willing to be flexible on, and which ones you\u2019re not. For instance, maybe you are willing to work on a couple of different specialty floors, but you\u2019re not going to take an assignment with only eight-hour shifts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##### **Ask your colleagues, friends, and family for recommendations on a good travel nurse recruiter**.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re unable to dig up any good leads from your existing network, branch out. Take a look at websites for nursing recruitment agencies and their social media accounts to find reviews left by other travel nurses about specific recruiters. You will likely also encounter warnings from nurses about specific recruiters to avoid at all costs! Take note from your fellow travelers.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n##### **Interview your recruiter.**\r\n\r\nWhen going into the first consult with your recruiter, come prepared with a list of questions using the following guidance:\r\n\r\n1. Find out how long they have been working as a travel nurse recruiter. One year of solid experience should be sufficient for someone working in this industry.\r\n2. Ask them how many travel nurses they typically work with at the same time. Even the very best nurse recruiters will likely have a hard time juggling more than 20 nurses.\r\n3. Check their availability. Will you only be able to contact them from Monday to Friday during regular business hours? Will the recruiter offer their phone or another contact number for off days and hours? Also, find out the best way to contact them.\r\n4. Ask the recruiter if they ever submit nurses to assignments without their permission. Many recruiters will submit employees to travel nursing jobs without direct permission just because the nurse expressed interest. You can run into problems quickly if this happens to you, especially if you are discussing jobs with several travel nursing companies and one finds out about another\u2019s submission of you to a travel assignment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Are You Ready to Talk to a Travel Nurse Recruiter?\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve found your home for transparency and honesty.

Are you ready to cross the picket line and make good money on strike nursing jobs? Learn more about nursing strikes and seven considerations for taking on this type of travel nursing assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Does a Nursing Strike Work?\r\n\r\nNursing strikes in the United States occur when the two sides cannot reach a compromise on a contract or bargaining agreement. At that point, the union will decide whether or not to strike. Typically, strikes occur when a collective bargaining agreement or contract is up for renewal.\r\n\r\nSome of the most newsworthy strikes in the past ten years include the [Minnesota Nurses Associate Strike](https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2016\/10\/minnesota-nurses-association-strike\/) which lasted 38 days in 2017 and the [Kaiser Permanente Mental Health Clinicians strike](https:\/\/nuhw.org\/kaiser-statewide-strike-dates-and-locations\/) that involved nurses in December of 2018. In order to gain a more favorable bargaining position, the hospital may hold a lockout or a strike.\r\n\r\nNo matter which decision is reached (a lockout or a strike) there is a minimum of 10 days notice the unions and hospitals must provide in advance of a nursing strike in order to get an agreement negotiated or plans made to transfer patients and temporary staff lined up to provide care.\r\n\r\nNurses who participate in the strike usually have to forfeit pay during the duration. Unions advise the nurses not to use sick time or vacation time in most instances. If there are funds from the union to support nurses during the strike, they are typically quite meager. Understandably, you can see why nurses who are actively striking take the matter quite personally and seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How a Nursing Strike is Different than a Corporate Strike\r\n\r\nA corporate strike and a US nursing strike are two entirely different labor disputes. Workers and nurses will go on strike for similar reasons, such as low pay, poor working conditions, etc., but the implications of a nursing strike are far greater than those of a corporation strike. Why?\r\n\r\nWhen a corporate strike occurs, the company is likely going to shut down if they do not bring in other workers. Subsequently, business owners, managers, and workers are affected by a corporate strike. However, when nurses go on strike, besides business owners and employees, there is another (and quite vulnerable) population affected: patients.\r\n\r\nPatients still need care so the burden lies on the hospital to ensure strike nurses can come in and keep the hospital running and patients alive! Travel nurses are often used by the hospital in these instances to fill the vacant positions. If you are a travel nurse considering working strike nursing jobs, here are seven considerations to keep in mind about working at a striking hospital during its labor dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Seven Considerations for Travel Nurses Working Strike Nursing Jobs\r\n\r\n#### **1. Treatment from the striking nurses**\r\n\r\nIf you enter a hospital as a replacement during the strike, the nurses who are currently on strike may look you unkindly. Take. Nothing. Personal. Those nurses participating in the strike are invested emotionally and have strong feelings toward the hospital and the ongoing labor dispute. When stepping onto the nursing floor to work during a hospital strike, even though it\u2019s your first day at the hospital, you may feel like a traitor working while other nurses are in refusal, demanding safer working conditions, better staffing ratios, or higher pay. Keep the patients\u2019 wellbeing your top priority. Have you ever heard the phrase \u201cthese are not my monkeys, not my circus\u201d? It\u2019s true. You are not personally involved in any of the reasons those nurses chose to strike, so remember why you\u2019re there in the first place \u2013 to provide care for patients who desperately need your skills. The last thing anyone wants during a nursing strike is for the patients to end up casualties of the labor dispute.\r\n\r\n#### **2. Securing your nursing license for the strike nursing contract**\r\n\r\nIf you already have a compact nursing license and the state that the strike is in is part of the compact, you should be ready to go. If you do not have an active nursing license in the state that the strike is in, then you need to get on it! The [nurse staffing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/) you work with will assist you to get the license that you need in time for the strike, in accordance with each state\u2019s requirements. Furthermore, the hospital will also assist with fees and expediting this process in order to get the travel nurses they need as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n#### **3. Considerations for your safety while working a nursing strike**\r\n\r\nAny labor dispute, including one at a hospital, is the perfect recipe for a tense environment that may cause concerns for safety. Most hospitals are aware of this and may provide transportation for the strike nurses to and from the hospital for each shift. An alternative entrance to the hospital may be provided to allow the travel nurses to avoid the picket line. While working on the job, keep your safety in mind by following the following three tips:\r\n\r\n1. Travel in pairs or groups with other travel nurses and never divulge where you are staying.\r\n2. When avoidable, do not wear your hospital badge, ID, or scrubs in public to identify yourself.\r\n3. Stay out of the politics involving the labor dispute. Remember, not your monkeys, not your circus. No matter how you feel or your perceptions on the nursing labor dispute, do not engage in conversations about the strike and keep a professional distance from the people who are working in the hospital \u2013 not on strike.\r\n\r\n#### **4. Hours nurses work during a strike**\r\n\r\nGet ready to put in the hours while you are working a strike as a travel nurse! You are going to find a skeleton crew holding up the pillars of the entire hospital during a nursing strike. As one of the few nurses working during the strike, you will be expected to work more than 40 hours in the week. A typical expectation is about 60 hours per week.\r\n\r\n#### **5. Housing for travel nurses working strikes**\r\n\r\nYour travel and accommodations will be covered while you work a strike nursing contract, but they\u2019re not going to be the same as if you were working a standard [13-week travel nursing assignment](\/jobs\/). Round-trip airfare will be covered as well as transportation to the hospital from your hotel. Don\u2019t be surprised if you will need to stay in a hotel with a shared room with another nurse working the strike.\r\n\r\n#### **6. Travel nursing \u201cshortened orientation\u201d on steroids**\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret that nurses who travel are given a shorter orientation than staff nurses. However, when working a strike, this condensation is on steroids! Be prepared for a crash course on everything from the hospital policies and procedures, computer charting, and regulatory requirements. Typically you will complete a skills check off and receive an introduction to the equipment and unit policies, and then you will be on your own.\r\n\r\n#### **7. Compensation for nurse striking jobs\u00a0**\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know already, strike nursing contracts compensate very well. Most of the travel nursing jobs for strikes last about two weeks at a time. On average, a strike nurse makes between $3,000 and $5,000 per week. However, some hospitals that are in a hard place and financially able will pay double that amount! Plus, on a strike nursing job, you are typically paid in full once you arrive at the strike nursing location. Typically, you will receive this pay even if the strike ends before you\u2019ve completed the assignment length.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Is Strike Nursing Right for You?\r\n\r\nIf you are ready to work and serve patients who desperately need your qualified skills, strike nursing provides generous compensation that makes it worthwhile.

Are you ready to cross the picket line and make good money on strike nursing jobs? Learn more about nursing strikes and seven considerations for taking on this type of travel nursing assignment.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does a Nursing Strike Work?<\/h2>\n<p>Nursing strikes in the United States occur when the two sides cannot reach a compromise on a contract or bargaining agreement. At that point, the union will decide whether or not to strike. Typically, strikes occur when a collective bargaining agreement or contract is up for renewal.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the most newsworthy strikes in the past ten years include the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2016\/10\/minnesota-nurses-association-strike\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Minnesota Nurses Associate Strike<\/a> which lasted 38 days in 2017 and the <a href=\"https:\/\/nuhw.org\/kaiser-statewide-strike-dates-and-locations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kaiser Permanente Mental Health Clinicians strike<\/a> that involved nurses in December of 2018. In order to gain a more favorable bargaining position, the hospital may hold a lockout or a strike.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which decision is reached (a lockout or a strike) there is a minimum of 10 days notice the unions and hospitals must provide in advance of a nursing strike in order to get an agreement negotiated or plans made to transfer patients and temporary staff lined up to provide care.<\/p>\n<p>Nurses who participate in the strike usually have to forfeit pay during the duration. Unions advise the nurses not to use sick time or vacation time in most instances. If there are funds from the union to support nurses during the strike, they are typically quite meager. Understandably, you can see why nurses who are actively striking take the matter quite personally and seriously.<\/p>\n<h2>How a Nursing Strike is Different than a Corporate Strike<\/h2>\n<p>A corporate strike and a US nursing strike are two entirely different labor disputes. Workers and nurses will go on strike for similar reasons, such as low pay, poor working conditions, etc., but the implications of a nursing strike are far greater than those of a corporation strike. Why?<\/p>\n<p>When a corporate strike occurs, the company is likely going to shut down if they do not bring in other workers. Subsequently, business owners, managers, and workers are affected by a corporate strike. However, when nurses go on strike, besides business owners and employees, there is another (and quite vulnerable) population affected: patients.<\/p>\n<p>Patients still need care so the burden lies on the hospital to ensure strike nurses can come in and keep the hospital running and patients alive! Travel nurses are often used by the hospital in these instances to fill the vacant positions. If you are a travel nurse considering working strike nursing jobs, here are seven considerations to keep in mind about working at a striking hospital during its labor dispute.<\/p>\n<h2>Seven Considerations for Travel Nurses Working Strike Nursing Jobs<\/h2>\n<h4><strong>1.

When stepping onto the nursing floor to work during a hospital strike, even though it&#8217;s your first day at the hospital, you may feel like a traitor working while other nurses are in refusal, demanding safer working conditions, better staffing ratios, or higher pay.

Have you ever heard of working as a per diem nurse?\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the difference between the two? We explore what it means to be a travel nurse and what it means to be a per diem nurse \u2013 and the pros and cons of both types of nursing careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Per Diem Nursing?\r\n\r\nTo understand what it means to work as a per diem nurse you basically just need to know that \u201cper diem\u201d means \u201cby the day\u201d. While the terms and conditions vary according to the hospital or [nursing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com) you work for, a per diem nurse is similar to a nurse working on call in the sense that they may be called and offered a shift simply hours before it starts.\r\n\r\nPer diem nursing also differs from being an on-call nurse because they may have been assigned a shift, or a couple of weeks of shifts, to cover a hospital\u2019s upcoming openings due to vacation or time off in advance. A per diem nurse might also work longer or shorter hours, by being willing to come in and pick up half a shift, a full shift, a shift and a half, or even a double.\r\n\r\nSimilar to how travel nurses are brought in to cover periods of increased demands such as flu season, holidays, or summer when nurses often take vacations, a per diem nurse might be hired for this type of coverage.\r\n\r\nIf you love flexibility and being able to decide when and where you want to work, you might enjoy working as a per diem nurse. Just think, your nursing agency calls you and you can decide whether or not to accept a shift. You also might be offered many holiday shifts, in which you can earn that sweet time and a half, double time, or even more in certain instances.\r\n\r\n### What are the Advantages of Per Diem Nursing?\r\n\r\n- Nurses choose when and where they want to work.\r\n- Per diem nurses can decline a shift if they don\u2019t feel like working.\r\n- Per diem nurses work on a temporary basis through hospitals or agencies.\r\n- Nurses working per diem can earn higher salaries than the regular staff nurses they work next to.\r\n- Per diem nursing allows you to be more available for your family and children.\r\n- When working as a per diem nurse, you are not tied or obligated to a specific work schedule.\r\n- Per diem nurses are not required to work a holiday or a weekend \u2013 ever.\r\n\r\n### What are the Disadvantages of Working as a Per Diem Nurse?\r\n\r\n- Per diem nurses do not receive job benefits.\r\n- Sometimes there is less of a need for per diem nurses.\r\n- Per diem nurses may have to go a week or two without work.\r\n- Financial strain can result if there is no other source of benefits or income for the nurse.\r\n- There is relatively low job security,\r\n- Assignments may be canceled, even last minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\nTravel nursing assignments typically range from 13 to 25 weeks and include a large number of specialties. Much like per diem nurses, travel nurses are hired for just a limited time at a specific location. A travel nurse may go anywhere and everywhere around the country to help fill in the gaps for patients who need them most in hospitals with extended staffing needs.\r\n\r\nTravel nurses are able to choose between a plethora of travel nursing assignments in various locations throughout the United States for different lengths of time. Typically nurses who travel love this freedom which allows them to choose where and when they want to work. Nurses who love the ability to take off extra time when needed and not be stuck in the same old routine day after day might love the freedom travel nursing jobs provide.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been stuck working for a company that didn\u2019t quite meet your expectations in terms of management? If you were working as a travel nurse, you\u2019d have the ability to shop around and try out different [travel nursing agencies](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com) and even choose your own travel nurse recruiter for your next assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the Advantages of Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\n- Travel nursing benefits are generous and include things such as: - Paid housing and expenses\r\n- Tax-free benefits\r\n- Full medical, dental, and vision insurance benefits\r\n- Sign-on, referral, and completion bonuses\r\n- Licensure reimbursement\r\n- Travel nurses can decide where they want to live and work.\r\n- Essentially, working as a travel nurse can feel like being on vacation, all the time.\r\n- Travel nurses are able to take substantial time off in between assignments.\r\n- For those looking to beat the weather for a season, they can take a travel nursing assignment in a location with a different climate.\r\n- Nurses who travel can decide to change locations as often as the contracts allow, or pick up new contracts in the same area or state.\r\n- Travel nurses have numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth by working and living in new locations.\r\n- If you\u2019re considering moving to a certain location, working there first as a travel nurse can give you a better idea of how you like it.\r\n- Working as a travel nurse brings in higher pay than working as a staff nurse, which allows provides for a comfortable lifestyle.\r\n- Paid housing benefits allow travel nurses to bypass the inflated costs of living in the United States.\r\n- Unlike per diem nurses, travel nurses enjoy the security of guaranteed hours, which means they are not able to be canceled, or cancellation policies, which allow them to get paid in the rare event they were called off the shift.\r\n- Travel nurses are often given the opportunity to extend their contract if there is still a need at the facility.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n## What are the Disadvantages of Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\n- Travel nurses do not have as much flexibility in their schedule as do per diem nurses.\r\n- Usually, travel nurses are required to work the same shifts in terms of every other weekend and holidays, as are staff nurses.\r\n- If the travel nurse is not satisfied with their nursing staffing agency or management at a hospital, they are still required to complete the duration of the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do You Want to Advance Your Nursing Career and Work as a Travel or Per Diem Nurse?\r\n\r\nAre you ready to jump into the fast-paced and exciting world of travel and per diem nursing?

While the terms and conditions vary according to the hospital or <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\">nursing agency<\/a> you work for, a per diem nurse is similar to a nurse working on call in the sense that they may be called and offered a shift simply hours before it starts.<\/p>\n<p>Per diem nursing also differs from being an on-call nurse because they may have been assigned a shift, or a couple of weeks of shifts, to cover a hospital&#8217;s upcoming openings due to vacation or time off in advance. A per diem nurse might also work longer or shorter hours, by being willing to come in and pick up half a shift, a full shift, a shift and a half, or even a double.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to how travel nurses are brought in to cover periods of increased demands such as flu season, holidays, or summer when nurses often take vacations, a per diem nurse might be hired for this type of coverage.<\/p>\n<p>If you love flexibility and being able to decide when and where you want to work, you might enjoy working as a per diem nurse. Just think, your nursing agency calls you and you can decide whether or not to accept a shift. You also might be offered many holiday shifts, in which you can earn that sweet time and a half, double time, or even more in certain instances.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the Advantages of Per Diem Nursing?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Nurses choose when and where they want to work.<\/li>\n<li>Per diem nurses can decline a shift if they don&#8217;t feel like working.<\/li>\n<li>Per diem nurses work on a temporary basis through hospitals or agencies.<\/li>\n<li>Nurses working per diem can earn higher salaries than the regular staff nurses they work next to.<\/li>\n<li>Per diem nursing allows you to be more available for your family and children.<\/li>\n<li>When working as a per diem nurse, you are not tied or obligated to a specific work schedule.<\/li>\n<li>Per diem nurses are not required to work a holiday or a weekend &#8211; ever.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What are the Disadvantages of Working as a Per Diem Nurse?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Per diem nurses do not receive job benefits.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes there is less of a need for per diem nurses.<\/li>\n<li>Per diem nurses may have to go a week or two without work.<\/li>\n<li>Financial strain can result if there is no other source of benefits or income for the nurse.<\/li>\n<li>There is relatively low job security,<\/li>\n<li>Assignments may be canceled, even last minute.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What is Travel Nursing?<\/h2>\n<p>Travel nursing assignments typically range from 13 to 25 weeks and include a large number of specialties. Much like per diem nurses, travel nurses are hired for just a limited time at a specific location. A travel nurse may go anywhere and everywhere around the country to help fill in the gaps for patients who need them most in hospitals with extended staffing needs.<\/p>\n<p>Travel nurses are able to choose between a plethora of travel nursing assignments in various locations throughout the United States for different lengths of time. Typically nurses who travel love this freedom which allows them to choose where and when they want to work. Nurses who love the ability to take off extra time when needed and not be stuck in the same old routine day after day might love the freedom travel nursing jobs provide.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever been stuck working for a company that didn&#8217;t quite meet your expectations in terms of management? If you were working as a travel nurse, you&#8217;d have the ability to shop around and try out different <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\">travel nursing agencies<\/a> and even choose your own travel nurse recruiter for your next assignment.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Advantages of Travel Nursing?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel nursing benefits are generous and include things such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Paid housing and expenses<\/li>\n<li>Tax-free benefits<\/li>\n<li>Full medical, dental, and vision insurance benefits<\/li>\n<li>Sign-on, referral, and completion bonuses<\/li>\n<li>Licensure reimbursement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Travel nurses can decide where they want to live and work.<\/li>\n<li>Essentially, working as a travel nurse can feel like being on vacation, all the time.<\/li>\n<li>Travel nurses are able to take substantial time off in between assignments.<\/li>\n<li>For those looking to beat the weather for a season, they can take a travel nursing assignment in a location with a different climate.<\/li>\n<li>Nurses who travel can decide to change locations as often as the contracts allow, or pick up new contracts in the same area or state.<\/li>\n<li>Travel nurses have numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth by working and living in new locations.<\/li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re considering moving to a certain location, working there first as a travel nurse can give you a better idea of how you like it.<\/li>\n<li>Working as a travel nurse brings in higher pay than working as a staff nurse, which allows provides for a comfortable lifestyle.<\/li>\n<li>Paid housing benefits allow travel nurses to bypass the inflated costs of living in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike per diem nurses, travel nurses enjoy the security of guaranteed hours, which means they are not able to be canceled, or cancellation policies, which allow them to get paid in the rare event they were called off the shift.<\/li>\n<li>Travel nurses are often given the opportunity to extend their contract if there is still a need at the facility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h2>What are the Disadvantages of Travel Nursing?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel nurses do not have as much flexibility in their schedule as do per diem nurses.<\/li>\n<li>Usually, travel nurses are required to work the same shifts in terms of every other weekend and holidays, as are staff nurses.<\/li>\n<li>If the travel nurse is not satisfied with their nursing staffing agency or management at a hospital, they are still required to complete the duration of the contract.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Do You Want to Advance Your Nursing Career and Work as a Travel or Per Diem Nurse?<\/h2>\n<p>Are you ready to jump into the fast-paced and exciting world of travel and per diem nursing?

Worried. Apprehensive. Excited, even. However you feel, keep in mind that you don\u2019t have to step onto the floor unprepared! Whether you are a first-time travel nurse or a seasoned nurse who travels, here are some travel nursing tips to help you calm those first day jitters and step into your new position feeling confident and ready to rock and roll! \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Know Where to Go and What to Do on Arrival\r\n\r\n This first tip is huge. Whether you are starting an assignment in a state far away from home or just a couple of hours away, you need to know where to go. I\u2019m not just talking about how to get to the facility. It\u2019s also important that you know what to do once you arrive! Try taking a dry run the day before. With factors involved, such as traffic, construction, and other commute timing issues, even with Google Maps or GPS en route \u2013 you may find the transit takes more or less time than anticipated. Take a dry run the day before your assignment. Leave at the time you think you\u2019ll need to leave on day one so that you can figure out the route. Once you arrive at the facility, it\u2019s important that you figure out where to park. Sometimes just finding the right spot in the parking garage and walking into the hospital can consume a significant amount of your allotted time for preparation, especially when working at a large hospital. Your recruiter should have you well-equipped with instructions for your first day. These will include where to go once you arrive, where to sign in, what you\u2019re supposed to wear, and a basic rundown of what to expect when you get there. During your test run, be sure to figure out how much time it takes to get to the unit you\u2019ll be working on or signing in at. Be sure that you also get the phone number to the hospital and have it saved in your phone, just in case you need it later. \u00a0 \r\n## 2. Get a Solid Night\u2019s Rest\r\n\r\n Just like a child who can\u2019t sleep on Christmas Eve, busy anticipating what the next day will hold, you may find it hard to close your eyes and get sound rest the night before the first day of a travel nursing assignment (except that you know there are no presents in store besides maybe a hospital pen and a name badge). Even though your body will likely be worked up and your mind racing with thoughts about the next day, it\u2019s imperative that you follow a good routine and lay down early to be sure that you get adequate rest for your first day. Avoid sugar and caffeine the night before a travel assignment. If there is anything you normally do to help you relax, such as drinking a glass of wine or taking a long bubble bath \u2013 do so the night before your first day to ensure you drift off to sleep. \u00a0 \r\n## 3. Bring Everything You Need to Work on Day One\r\n\r\n Even if your recruiter has assured you that the first day is just an orientation to the facility and you won\u2019t be required to work, come prepared to work anyways. Anything can happen. Bring your scrubs, proper footwear, name badge, your favorite pen, stethoscope, all those tools you need to perform your job duties. Additionally, bring copies of all your paperwork, licenses, certifications, and pocket cards, even if your recruiter has already sent these documents in. Nothing is more stressful than arriving and being turned down to work right away by human resources because you are missing a piece of documentation. Ideally, you should have these items both printed off and saved as digital copies on a USB drive. You never know how long orientation might last so pack a healthy snack and a bottle of water. Also, be sure to bring some cash too, because every facility does not take credit cards for lunch. \u00a0 \r\n## 4. Show Up Early to Your First Day of a Travel Nursing Assignment\r\n\r\n First impressions are everything. Consider how long the \u201cdry run\u201d took you to arrive at the facility, and adjust your departure time accordingly. Ideally, you should arrive about 15 minutes early. Do your best to continue this routine throughout the duration of your travel nursing assignment. This consistency will also look great on your resume for future jobs and your travel nursing recruiter can stress this as one of your merits to potential employers in the future. \u00a0 \r\n## 5. Get Oriented to the Routine Fast with the Right Questions\r\n\r\n As a travel nurse, your hospital or facility orientation is going to be fast-paced. You\u2019re going to learn the most when you are actually on the job. It\u2019s important that you know which questions to ask. Write down a list of questions that you want to know, such as codes to access the laundry or medication rooms, specific unit policies regarding insulin administration, who is able to start IVs on the unit, what can be delegated to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP), etc. \u00a0 \r\n## 6. Bring a Positive Attitude and a Team Spirit\r\n\r\n Smile big on your first day. Even if you are nervous, this smile will help you look *and* feel more confident. Be ready to jump in and help out your fellow team members on the floor. Sometimes you might be given a lesser assignment on your first day so that you can quickly orient to the unit and workflow. If this is the case and you find yourself with some extra time, be sure to jump in and assist other team members that need an extra hand. \u00a0 \r\n## 7. Introduce Yourself and Take Names\r\n\r\n Even if you know that you won\u2019t remember their names in the next hour \u2013 at least try and make the effort. Introduce yourself to your new co-workers with a confident smile and a firm handshake. Make a special effort to remember the names of those you will be working with on a consistent basis. Remember, at most facilities, you also work with UAP, secretaries, or LPNs, that should be given the same respect. Be sure not to just make an effort to get to know your fellow nurses, but the others you will be working directly with as these staff members often become the ones you will interact with the most. \u00a0 \r\n## Discover Your Next Travel Nursing Job Today\r\n\r\n Are you a first-time travel nurse looking to secure your first assignment?

New Jersey is certainly no exception to this rule. Experts predict that by the year 2030, the workforce in NJ is going to be lacking about 11,400 nurses in order to meet the demand for medical services in the state.\r\n\r\nImpeding worsening of this nursing shortage has caused the two-decade-old debate over whether New Jersey will join the [enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/11945.htm) (eNLC) to re-emerge. Just last month, a big step was taken in the direction of adding New Jersey to the agreement that will allow nurses licensed in the state to freely practice in the 29 other states already in the agreement \u2013 and it will also open the doors for those same nurses in compact states to practice in New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Legislation that Adds the Garden State to the eNLC has been Introduced\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 2019, the New Jersey State Senate approved in a unanimous vote a piece of legislation that will authorize the state to participate in the multi-state Nurse Licensure Compact which is known as the eNLC. This is a national program that provides mobility and freedom for nurse professionals to work in multiple states in order to combat the plague of nursing shortages affecting the US. Other technology is also propped up by the nursing license compact through the support of telemedicine and other care delivery that crosses state borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Does the Enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact Work?\r\n\r\nWhile there is still a final vote needed in the Assembly, the eNLC model that has been outlined in the NJ legislation would require nurses to meet the licensing qualifications set forth by the state in which they reside, whether that be NJ or another member state.\r\n\r\nWhen any travel nurse in the compact is working and providing care, they must still meet all of the regulations set forth by the state in which they are practicing. Furthermore, the multi-state compact also has a shared database in which all states must enter any nursing violations into the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the Concerns Over NJ Entering the eNLC?\r\n\r\nWhile many are in full support of the Garden State becoming the next to join the eNLC, there are some nursing groups who remain opposed to the change. What are their reasons?\r\n\r\nNew Jersey is a bit heavy when it comes to the requirements needed from its nurses. In some cases, the standards for nurse licensing in New Jersey are higher than other participating jurisdictions. Could allowing nurses from other states who adhere to fewer restrictions diminish the quality of care provided to patients in the Garden State? This is a valid question which concerned parties have expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the Benefits of New Jersey Joining the eNLC?\r\n\r\nThe official New Jersey Business and Industry Association is in strong support of the bill as it will help make it easier to recruit the much-needed nursing staff. A nurse and clinical professor at Rutgers School of Nursing and also a lead for the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (which studies workforce issues), Edna Cadmus [stated](http:\/\/www.njccn.org\/):\r\n\r\n> \u201cI see this as a very positive step. It allows for greater mobility, and greater mobility will help us in dealing with shortages. It also really helps reduce some of the duplication in licensing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Supply and Demand Affects Nurses Working in New Jersey and Nationwide\r\n\r\nIf a nurse who currently holds a license in New Jersey wants to work in another state, they must seek out licensure in that state. Vice versa, if a nurse wants to take a job position in New Jersey, they must obtain Garden State credentials. Either way, the New Jersey Board of Nursing already oversees the credentials of more than 220,000 healthcare professionals, of which, more than half are registered nurses or RNs. It\u2019s this same board of nursing that is in charge of processing all this licensing and managing all the aspects of education and regulations in the profession.\r\n\r\nSome people insist that the management concerns and staff shortages at the board have made it much more challenging to obtain nursing certification in New Jersey. Those who are critics of the multi-state compact in the state of New Jersey argue that by adding this increased workload to the nursing board, the problem with delays will only be exacerbated.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, lawmakers and advocates [brought these issues of the board being overburdened to attention](https:\/\/www.njspotlight.com\/stories\/17\/10\/05\/critics-say-chronic-problems-in-nj-nursing-board-are-danger-to-patients\/) and the former Gov. Chris Christie appointed additional board members at that time. Regardless, the state officials at that time suggested that the board had appropriate staffing. The state nursing board falls under the Department of Consumer Affairs in New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supply and Demand for Nurses Nationwide Varies\r\n\r\nSubstantial variability exists in the supply and demand of the workforce of nurses from state to state according to a report from the national Health Resources and Services Administration (which is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) from [July 2017.](http:\/\/www.njccn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/HRSA-Supply-and-Demand-2014-2030.pdf)\r\n\r\nAs an example of this supply and demand variables, it\u2019s estimated that by 2030 New Jersey will be short by about 11,400 nurses (which will make it one of four states looking at 10,000-plus deficiency) \u2013 but at that same time, it\u2019s estimated that New York will have at least 18,000 nurses in surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n## History of the Nurse Licensure Compact\r\n\r\nThe very first multi-state compact involved Texas and Wisconsin in 2000, and the [National Council of State Boards of Nursing](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/nurse-licensure-compact.htm) helped organize the arrangement. Since then, the agreement has gained steam and there are currently 29 states involved in the compact, with more that have agreed to join soon and several others with pending legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Nurses Unions have Concerns Regarding Multi-State Licensure\r\n\r\nThere are 11 states that have not gotten involved in the talks regarding joining the compact such as New York and Pennsylvania, and this also includes labor-friendly states such as Ohio and California. There are nurses unions, such as the Health Professionals and Allied Employees (which is the largest group of this kind in New Jersey), who have not shown support for the plan because they are concerned that this could [lower the standards](https:\/\/www.njspotlight.com\/stories\/15\/10\/22\/rise-of-telemedicine-drives-move-toward-multi-state-nursing-agreement\/) for workfoce qualifications. Earlier versions of the bill raised concerns like this with the New Jersey State Nurses Association, but the compact in its current form is fully supported by this body.\r\n\r\nThe criminal background check processes are at the core of these types of concerns. There are several states which are part of the compact that do not have the same level of requirements when it comes to checking the criminal background history of a nurse. The argument, therefore, is that this agreement could allow nurses with dangerous backgrounds to work in the Garden State.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, it was this very concern that was mostly responsible for the failure of the previous attempt made for New Jersey to join the eNLC. However, since 2006, there has been bi-partisan support to [re-start the process](https:\/\/www.njspotlight.com\/stories\/15\/10\/22\/rise-of-telemedicine-drives-move-toward-multi-state-nursing-agreement\/). Groups such as HPAE have been urging lawmakers to include requirements that would mandate any out-of-state nurse to meet the requirements according to the standards in New Jersey, but so far none of those efforts made it through the committees and floor votes.\r\n\r\nIf the governor were to sign the latest version of the law [(S-954)](https:\/\/www.njleg.state.nj.us\/2018\/Bills\/S1000\/954_R1.PDF), it would immediately go into effect. The [legislation is](https:\/\/www.njspotlight.com\/stories\/19\/02\/21\/nj-moves-closer-to-joining-multi-state-licensing-pact-for-nurses\/) \u201cled by Sens. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), the longtime health committee chairman, Troy Singleton (D-Burlington) and Fred Madden (D-Gloucester) and co-sponsored by Sen. Declan O\u2019Scanlon (R-Monmouth). Assemblyman Herb Conaway (D-Burlington), a physician and chair of that house\u2019s health committee, heads up the companion version, which cleared several Assembly panels last month.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf it goes through, New Jersey will be able to participate in the compact and share nurses [both RNs and licensed practical\/vocational nurses (LPN\/VNs)] from the license pool. The state will also be required to participate in the interstate commission that operates the compact.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed agreement, if a nurse working in the Garden State violates the regulations set forth by the state, New Jersey would be allowed to revoke or suspend the license of any nurse in the pool, regardless of where they live or where they are licensed. Any adverse actions such taken by the state would need to be logged in the shared database. There is also an operating fee of $6,000 annually that would need to be paid by the officials of the state for the expenses of the compact.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the agreement will require the New Jersey Attorney General to evaluate how the participation in the compact is doing after one year\u2019s time and report the pros and cons to the governor and Legislature. If the evaluation made by the AG suggests that states with lower standards for licensing have joined the group (which could allow less-qualified caregivers to work in New Jersey) \u2013 the state would be allowed to withdraw from the compact at that time.\r\n\r\nAt Elite Specialty Staffing, we follow and report on the issues that matter most to travel nurses.

Why? This field is expanding exponentially because of the importance of nursing informatics and the impact it has on everyday patient care, documentation, and procedures.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\u00a0of current healthcare IT systems and the implementation of new software in healthcare, such as electronic health records (EHR),\u00a0have profound implications for the delivery of healthcare and patient outcomes. As a nurse or even a travel nurse, working in healthcare IT, you are trusted to combine your clinical nursing skills and technical knowledge to help improve patient care.\r\n\r\nAs hospitals increase their usage and dependence on healthcare IT systems such as EHRs, electronic order entering systems, and coding applications, there is a growing demand for technical departments that have both clinical and non-clinical professionals working in them. As a nurse informaticist, you can become a core member of a hospital or health system\u2019s clinical IT team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Nursing Informatics?\r\n\r\nA field of nursing which focuses on the delivery of high-quality patient care through the analysis and management of healthcare data and technical systems is called nursing informatics. A nurse working in the informatics field can:\r\n\r\n- Analyze trends\r\n- Monitor for recurrent errors\r\n- Implement new systems\r\n- Improve the efficiency of current processes\r\n\r\n\r\n## How do You Find Nursing Informatics Jobs?\r\n\r\nNursing informatics jobs come in many different settings and roles and can be found under various titles. The following are types of roles and titles given to nurses working in informatics, (their specifics may vary):\r\n\r\n- Nurse informaticist\r\n- Nursing informatics specialist\r\n- Nursing informatics clinician\r\n- Clinical informatics coordinator\r\n- Clinical analyst\r\n- Clinical nurse informatics specialist\r\n- IT clinical nurse\r\n- Perioperative informatics nurse\r\n\r\n\r\n## Nursing Informatics Job Descriptions\r\n\r\n*Healthcare* informatics is a field that deals mostly with the administrative side of healthcare data, such as registration and billing applications. *Nursing* informatics brings in the patient care aspect of healthcare and deals with the computer systems interacted with by the nursing and care staff. As such, registered nurses who work in informatics serve as a point of contact between the clinical nursing staff and the IT team or department.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s the Importance of Nursing Informatics?\r\n\r\nNursing informaticists effectively bridge the gap in communication between the clinicians using the software every day and the technical folk working \u201cin the trenches\u201d on the backend of the development and rollout of such applications. Effectively, nurse informaticists can make sure that the new tools and procedures being implemented will be practical and user-friendly for the application and use of such systems by all staff members involved.\r\n\r\nBecause a nurse with a clinical and technical background can help see both sides of the spectrum, they are in a unique position to help demonstrate how systems can be used to provide the best care for patients. Let\u2019s say a group of medical-surgical nurses is given training by a nursing informaticist, once that training is complete, that IT nurse will effectively serve as a point-of-contact for any questions that arise once the system is in place.\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving as a liaison between these two entities, nurse informaticists might also take part in:\r\n\r\n- Quality control\r\n- Systems development\r\n- Clinical staff training\r\n\r\n\r\n## Responsibilities of Nurses Working in Informatics\r\n\r\nHospitals are the most common employer for nursing informaticists according to a [study](https:\/\/www.himss.org\/sites\/himssorg\/files\/2017-nursing-informatics-workforce-full-report.pdf) conducted by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).

Within this blanket term of implementation includes the preparation of new technology and the support and training of clinical staff members.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where Do Nurse Informaticists Work?\r\n\r\nEver since the implementation of Meaningful Use and hospitals and healthcare facilities were driven to implement digital solutions, such as electronic health records (EHR) and computerized order entry (CPOE), technology solutions have been deeply entrenched throughout the healthcare realm.

As people get older, but are leading healthier lives, there is an increased demand for many healthcare services which drives the nation\u2019s need for nurses.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest factors that increases the need for nurse informaticists is the push for controlling healthcare spending and costs. The proper management of nursing data in medical facilities and hospitals can help managers and executives implement policies and make decisions that effectively lower healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the American Medical Informatics Association suggests that as many as [70,000 nursing informatics specialists\/analysts](http:\/\/nursing.advanceweb.com\/Features\/Articles\/Nursing-Informatics-A-Career-on-the-Rise.aspx) might be needed in the next five years.

Here are 10 Tips","slug":"10-travel-nursing-tips-for-bringing-pets-with-you-to-an-assignment","markdown":"\nCompanionship. Cuddles. Protection. Pets bring so much joy and satisfaction to the lives of their owners. If you are a pet owner and happen to be a travel nurse, a pet can also provide a sense of home while you\u2019re away from home. As such, many travel nurses choose to bring their\u00a0pet along with them during an assignment.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a lot of factors that can cause increased stress and anxiety for your pet during traveling such as long rides and plane trips. Furthermore, to bring your pet along to a travel nursing assignment can also add complexities to your logistics and travel arrangements. For these reasons, we have compiled these 10 travel nursing tips for bringing pets with you while you\u2019re on assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 10 Travel Nursing Tips for Bringing Pets on Assignment\r\n\r\n### 1. Plan Ahead to Travel with a Pet\r\n\r\nTravel nursing is all about planning ahead. In our previous blog post, we talked about how to [prepare for your first travel nursing assignment](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/wordpress\/11-tips-to-prepare-for-your-first-travel-nursing-job\/). A huge part of that planning included being sure all of your licensing, credentials, and documents are up to date. Same goes for your pet.\r\n\r\nEven if your pet is in perfect health, be sure to take them into a vet before you travel. At this appointment, get copies of your pet\u2019s vaccination records and associated health records.\r\n\r\nYou will also want to plan ahead and research the area you are traveling to for local veterinarians. It\u2019s a good idea to find a vet in the area you will be working on a travel nursing assignment that is open 24 hours in case you run into an emergency with your pet while you\u2019re there.\r\n\r\n### 2. Be Sure Your Pet Has Identification\r\n\r\nDoes your dog or cat have an updated ID tag with your correct information on it? Be sure they do! If you haven\u2019t already, get an ID tag for your dog that has your phone number and contact information visible and easy to read. You never know what could happen.\r\n\r\nWhile I was working on a travel nursing assignment, I had my dachshund escape from the camper when I looked away for just a moment! Luckily, she was wearing her ID tag with my current phone number on it, and she was found by a couple who called me and had her in their truck waiting to be picked up!\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t already had your pet microchipped, this would be the time to do it. No one likes to think about the worst case scenario, but there is an increased chance that your pet might get lost or out of your sight in an unfamiliar environment. If your pet has been microchipped, it will be much more likely you\u2019ll be able to find them and reunite if they were to get lost.\r\n\r\n### 3. Secure Housing and Accommodations that are Pet-Friendly\r\n\r\nWhile this travel nursing advice may seem obvious, it\u2019s easy to get so wrapped up in the logistics of your next travel nursing assignment that you may overlook this important step!\r\n\r\nFrom early on, be sure that you communicate with your travel nursing recruiter that you will be bringing a pet along. This allows plenty of time for your travel nursing staffing agency to secure pet-friendly housing.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on driving to your assignment, consider where you might stay if you have any necessary stops along the way. As you are mapping out the trip, figure out which hotels are pet-friendly along your route.\r\n\r\n### 4. Take Time for Breaks During the Trip\r\n\r\nMost fur babies travel with their owners by car to a [travel nursing assignment](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/wordpress\/jobs\/). If you are driving for several hours to get to your destination with your pet, be sure that you bring a carrier to keep them secure and allow for breaks. Dogs and cats alike will need to be taken out of their carrier as needed to stretch their legs or use the bathroom. Don\u2019t get so caught up in the drive that you forget about your pet.\r\n\r\n### 5. Pack Accordingly for Your Pet\r\n\r\nCertainly, you have a few comfort items that you want to be sure you bring with you for your assignment. Your pet is no different. Does your dog have a favorite toy? Does your cat have a certain bed they like to sleep on? By bringing along creature comforts that your pet is used to, it will help them to feel at home and comfortable during the travel nursing assignment. My <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-haired dachshund, Zoey, loved nothing more than putting on a cute little outfit and prancing around (seriously, this dog loved her clothes). For my travel nursing assignments in Florida, I brought along a couple of her favorite duds, and of course, her doggy bikini she proudly wore on the dog beaches. We also packed her items she used daily such as her bed and food bowels.<\/span>\r\n\r\n### 6. Bring a Travel Kit and Cleaning Supplies for the Trip\r\n\r\nTraveling can be very stressful on pets. Even if your dog or cat never has accidents at home, you never know what can happen when you\u2019re on the road. The last thing you want is to have your precious pet make an accident while en route, and you be helpless to clean it up. Bring a travel kit for your pet that includes all of their paperwork, medication, food, and cleaning supplies.\r\n\r\n### 7. Arrive to Your Assignment a Couple Days Early\r\n\r\nIf you want to ensure your travel nursing assignment with your pet is a successful one, you should arrive at the location at least a couple of days in advance. This allows your pet to get acclimated to their new environment. If you\u2019re bringing a dog with you, be sure you take it for a walk around the neighborhood so it will be less fearful and more aware of the new location they are living in.\r\n\r\n### 8. Consider Using a Pet Daycare\r\n\r\nNurses work long hours \u2013 usually 12-hour shifts. If you are traveling alone, this means that your pet is going to be spending significant time in solitude. If you are able to, you should really consider a doggy day care where your pet can go while you\u2019re at work. Some facilities also accept cats. You should be able to find such a service before you arrive for your assignment simply by searching online. By using a pet daycare service, you will be able to work feeling more relaxed knowing that your pet is receiving proper care while you\u2019re gone.\r\n\r\n### 9. Set a Routine\r\n\r\nOne of the very best ways to reduce fear and anxiety in your pet (and also helps to avoid accidents) is to set a routine and stick to it. Feed your pet the same time each day. Take them for a walk the same time each day. When your pet knows when they are supposed to use the bathroom each day, they will be less likely to have an accident. This practice also helps create a sense of familiarity and \u201chome\u201d for your pet, making them more comfortable during your travel nursing assignment.\r\n\r\n### 10. Do Not Neglect Your Pet\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive home after a long work day, the first thing you might want to do (especially if you work nights) is crawl into bed and get some zzzs. Before you do, make a conscious effort to first spend some time with your pet who was without you all day long. Take them for a short walk. Pull out their favorite toy and play. Or, just grab them up and get in some cuddle time. Afterall, pets are very therapuetic and this time together will also make you feel good and help you decompress from travel nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Are You Ready to Plan a Travel Nursing Assignment?\r\n\r\nOur specialty nursing staffing agency is here to help you.

Changing nursing jobs. Long shifts. Saving lives. Travel nurses work hard!\r\n\r\nDealing with all the extra pressures of adapting to new environments while leveraging a family life and social life can be taxing on your energy and motivation. Stress may be inevitable to a degree, but in order to stay healthy and prevent the stress from affecting you mentally, physically, or spiritually \u2013 decompression and downtime are key!\r\n\r\nStress can mess you up. It can affect your sleep. Mood. Anxiety levels. It\u2019s important to do something, anything, to help you de-stress and decompress during your time off travel nursing assignments or even after a long shift.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no denying that\u00a0travel nurses work hard. And, with the added pressure of adapting to new environments, family, and social life on top of taking care of all your patients, it\u2019s natural to get a little stressed every now and then. But, in order to be your very best, it\u2019s important to not let the stress take control of your mind and body.\r\n\r\nHere are five travel nursing tips on how to decompress and make the most of your time off.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Don\u2019t Take Your Work Home with You\r\n\r\nWhen I was working as a travel nurse, I often had to remind myself not to take my work home with me. For some people that work in the service industry or a factory setting, this type of conscious effort might be easier than it is for a nurse \u2013 you clock out and you\u2019re done.\r\n\r\nWhile working as a travel nurse, it may not seem so cut and dry. The stress of learning a whole new routine in an unfamiliar work environment can be challenging. Not to mention, working as a registered nurse and being there for patients during their most critical times and working closely with their family members concerning serious issues can be heavy day to day. But when you clock out, try free your mind of the workplace and avoid the habit of talking about work while you\u2019re not there.\r\n\r\nOne way to help accomplish this is to make use of a provided locker space on-site and physically drop off your things while mentally reminding yourself work stays at work. Bring a combination lock, and leave things at your workplace you either don\u2019t need while you\u2019re not working or don\u2019t want to have to laying around reminding you of work, plus you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting items, like your name badge!\r\n\r\nFor me, I left everything except my scrubs at the facility. My badge, clipboard, hemostats, random collection of 2x2s, tape, scissors, flashlight \u2013 you know all the typical arsenal a nurse uses \u2013 along with my nursing shoes. Keeping your nursing shoes clean and out of the weather and out of your living space with random hospital germs, is a great time saver and a way to leave work at work!\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Take Time to Exercise\r\n\r\nGet the endorphins flowing. Even if it\u2019s just a little bit. Exercise is the worst enemy of stress. It simply can\u2019t survive in its presence. Making the effort to get your body moving is going to pay off with gains in both the short term and the long term.\r\n\r\nWhile getting off work following a butt-kicking 12-hour shift might not have you feeling inspired to get to the gym \u2013 you might be surprised how effective working out right after work can be. It\u2019s a great way to clear your mind and unwind after a day working as a travel nurse.\r\n\r\nDo what makes sense for your schedule. If you feel like going for a run, do it. Hitting the gym? More power to you. At the very least, you can also walk around the facility you work. Even if you do not have the time to get the exercise in post-shift, you can increase your movement by taking the steps and challenging yourself to walk as much as possible while at work. No matter how fast you\u2019re going, [exercise is going to send energy throughout your body and increase endorphins and blood flow to the brain](https:\/\/adaa.org\/living-with-anxiety\/managing-anxiety\/exercise-stress-and-anxiety).\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Pay Extra Attention to Self-Care\r\n\r\nA common theme among travel nurses I worked with in the IT implementation field is that many of them were obsessed with self-care in the form of manicures, pedicures, massages, and I am sure you can include hair treatments, etc. To be honest, the job was amazing in the aspect that it was not tiring physically and you were basically were expected to stay awake and be available to answer questions when needed. Once the hospital staff was on the system for about a week, the rest of the three-month assignment had several shifts in which I answered only five or less questions in an entire 12-hour work day.\r\n\r\nAt first, I did not understand how many of the experienced traveling IT nurses would feel so stressed and splurge on self-pampering. However, this particular assignment offered (and most people took up) 12-hour shifts five to seven days a week. After I worked several 60-hour work weeks, I finally understood that even though the work was not physically exhausting and stressful, like staff nursing is, being at work for those long hours takes its toll. Taking the time to care for yourself helps keep you refreshed, it lifts your spirits, and can potentially help you avoid nursing burnout.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Clear Your Thoughts Through Meditation or Prayer\r\n\r\nEven if you\u2019re not into yoga per say \u2013 there is still great value in the practice of meditation. Do not be confused and think that you need incense and yoga pants in order to meditate. According to the [Mirriam-Webster dictionary](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/meditate), meditation means:\r\n\r\n1. \u201cTo engage in contemplation or reflection; or\r\n2. To engage in mental exercise (such as concentration on one\u2019s breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness.\u201d\r\n\r\nPrayer is another way you can spend time clearing your thoughts and feeding your spirituality. By taking this time to yourself where everything else is quiet and you can focus on your inner peace and thought processes, you can regroup, refocus, and recharge your spiritual energy \u2013 which you can use to provide the best possible care to patients without getting burned out.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. Don\u2019t Forget to be a Tourist on Days Off\r\n\r\nOne of the top reasons why nurses choose to [become a travel nurse](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/trade-in-your-permanent-address-to-become-a-travel-nurse\/) is to explore new locations and experience new cultures and meet new people. All too often, we as travel nurses get so caught up in doing the best we can to do a great job while we are at work, that we spend our time off simply trying to rest and prepare to go back to work.\r\n\r\nInstead of thinking about work on your days off, remember why you became a travel nurse in the first place, which includes experiencing new things. Grab your camera and your best \u201ctacky\u201d tourist shirt you can find (ok you can leave the shirt at home if you\u2019re not into that kind of thing), and get out there and explore the city you\u2019re working in. Find tourist websites and create a list of attractions and venues you want to see while you\u2019re on assignment.\r\n\r\nOn your days off, make a special effort to get out there and see and do all the things on your list. Also, keep your mind open to new opportunities as they arise that weren\u2019t on your initial list. \u201cWhere does this hiking trail lead?\u201d You\u2019ll never know unless you walk it. Who knows, you might just stumble upon the most beautiful waterfall you\u2019ve seen. Follow your intuition and be spontaneous, while using your smarts to stay safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ready to Find Your Dream Travel Nursing Job?\r\n\r\nCall us today at [208-378-1338](tel: 208-378-1338) to learn more about our opportunities for you to land the highest-paying travel nursing jobs in the United States.\r\n\r\n \n","html":"<p>Relocation.

No mandatory weekends. Top pay rates. Per diem nursing jobs offer a lot of flexibility and enticing pay rates for registered nurses. What does \u201cper diem\u201d mean? \u201cPer diem\u201d is a Latin term that technically means \u201cby the day\u201d. Per diem RN jobs are those in which the nurse is not hired for a permanent or temporary nursing contract on a specific unit, rather they are hired by the shift and they work where they are needed most in a healthcare facility.

It takes a ton of staff members, in particular nurses, to keep a hospital or healthcare facility up and running. Depending on the hospital\u2019s patient census, those needs fluctuate greatly from week to week. Day to day. Even, shift to shift. By hiring per diem nurses, healthcare staffing agencies can help cover the needs of communities on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. This hiring model saves the hospital or healthcare facility money because they can avoid hiring any permanent registered nurses for a temporary medical staffing need, such as during flu season.

It takes a ton of staff members, in particular nurses, to keep a hospital or healthcare facility up and running. Depending on the hospital\u2019s patient census, those needs fluctuate greatly from week to week. Day to day. Even, shift to shift.\r\n\r\nBy hiring per diem nurses, healthcare staffing agencies can help cover the needs of communities on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. This hiring model saves the hospital or healthcare facility money because they can avoid hiring any permanent registered nurses for a temporary medical staffing need, such as during flu season.\r\n\r\n[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row custom_width_px=&#8221;710px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;30px|0px|30px|0px|true|false&#8221; background_position_1=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat_1=&#8221;no-repeat&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.0.65&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Services Section Title&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.17.1&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; header_font=&#8221;Montserrat||||&#8221; header_text_color=&#8221;#1f1f1f&#8221; header_font_size=&#8221;36px&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;center&#8221; max_width=&#8221;710px&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; animation_style=&#8221;fold&#8221; animation_direction=&#8221;bottom&#8221; animation_intensity_fold=&#8221;20%&#8221;]\r\n<h1>Benefits of Working Per Diem as a Registered Nurse<\/h1>\r\n[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Services Section Subtitle&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.17.1&#8243; text_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;20px&#8221; header_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; text_orientation=&#8221;center&#8221; max_width=&#8221;710px&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; animation_style=&#8221;fold&#8221; animation_direction=&#8221;bottom&#8221; animation_intensity_fold=&#8221;20%&#8221;]\r\n\r\nAre you a nurse that marches to the beat of your own drum?

Here are five of the top reasons why nurses are considered the most trusted professionals in the United States.<\/div>\r\n## 1. They Advocate on Behalf of Their Patients\r\n\r\nHelpless. Unable to walk or talk. It\u2019s so hard not being able to do for yourself. While varying degrees\u00a0and abilities exist, still to be a patient is one of the most vulnerable states any person can be in. Nurses are a voice when a patient has none. They will advocate on your behalf and they\u2019re the type of people that you want to have on your team.\r\n\r\nPatient safety always comes first to a nurse. They are there to help patients make decisions that are informed. If you are the patient, they will connect you with the safety and resources you need to educate yourself and follow through with your course of treatment or care. Most nurses will also be the ultimate cheerleader in your corner, rooting you on to achieve the best possible outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. They Comfort and Hold the Hands of Your Loved Ones\r\n\r\nTwelve hours is a long time to spend at work. As such, nurses really get to know their patients. Many nurses will work with the same patient consecutively for several days and form attachments with them over the course of hospitalization.\r\n\r\nWhen your loved one is a patient in the hospital, the nurses are the ones who are there with them more than anyone else. It\u2019s not always possible, feasible, or healthy for a family member to remain with a patient 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\r\n\r\nNurses will take their patient\u2019s hand a while, as long as it\u2019s needed for comfort, support, guidance, even up to the last breath. It\u2019s important that family members and care providers take care of themselves as well in order to be healthy enough to care for their loved one who is the patient. Nurses encourage family members and other caregivers to go home and take a shower, sleep, and have a good meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. They Care for the Sick and Dying\r\n\r\nNurses certainly make a deep impact on the outcome and experience when it comes to taking care of a very sick or even dying family member. Their compassion and actions can set the entire ambiance for how the death or care for a sick family member is perceived by the family and experienced by the patient.\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse, the most profound experience I ever had is when I was at the bedside of a patient who peacefully passed away in front of her husband, daughter, granddaughter, and myself. I provided comfort and care for this patient and family by\u00a0the smallest of gestures from delivering a cart of complementary foods and drinks and being an ear to listen to the largest gestures by providing pain control for their beloved family member who was thrashing and crying out before I had arrived.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the only time I had patients return to the unit a few days later with gifts for me. They <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brought me momentos that attributed nurses to being angels, and also a customized coin with my name on it saying that I had a guardian angel in heaven. The granddaughter hugged me and told me that I had inspired her to one day become a nurse and their gestures brought tears to my eyes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n## **4. They Teach and Help Patients and Families Understand**\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a nurse, providing education is a huge part of the job. Whether it\u2019s instructing a patient how to take insulin injections, wound management for a bed sore, the importance of a diagnosis, or dietary management of disease, nurses spend a large amount of their time on the job teaching both patients and family members on how to properly manage their healthcare.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, extending beyond the bedside, you will find nurses fulfilling various teaching roles in the community. Nurses work at public healthcare centers providing education for staying healthy. Nurses are the ones in the universities sharing their knowledge and experience to the future nurses of the world in nursing colleges. No matter what setting the teaching is taking places, nurses will go above and beyond their scope to ensure that you are comfortable and have a good understanding of the subject at hand. They are patient and know how to share information in a way that is helpful and professional.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n## **5. They are Empathetic and Never Judge**\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s be honest, nurses have seen it all. Whether you are looking for someone to confide in regarding a personal matter or a health-related inquiry, you\u2019re likely never going to shock your nurse friend.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nurses are trained to be great listeners and will take in what you have to say with an open mind and an open heart while using open-ended communication techniques they\u2019ve acquired along their journey. Think, therapist for a minute. \u201cTell me more.\u201d \u201cHow does this make you feel?\u201d These are the types of open-ended questions nurses use to allow you to open up and explain yourself to someone better, and to make you feel like you\u2019ve been heard.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early on in nursing school, a student will realize whether or not they have what it takes to make it as a nurse. What this usually boils down to is empathy. The best nurses in the field are the ones who are truly empathetic and care for their patients, friends, family members, and others who surround them. Furthermore, since they have seen and heard so much in their lives, they are often the best when it comes to offering sound advice and encouragement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n## **6. They are Adaptable and Dependable**\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nurses thrive in various environments. Whether it\u2019s a staff nurse who has stayed in the same position for most of their career or a busy travel nurse, nurses have a fluid way of making themselves flexible in any given situation. They understand that their patients and team members rely on them to provide the best possible care and promote optimal outcomes for patients. In doing so, they learn to be dependable people you can count on when you need them most.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Are You Looking to Put Your Nursing Skills and Qualities to Work?**\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you searching for a travel nursing assignment that fits your skills and qualifications?

They are Adaptable and Dependable<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nurses thrive in various environments. Whether it&#8217;s a staff nurse who has stayed in the same position for most of their career or a busy travel nurse, nurses have a fluid way of making themselves flexible in any given situation. They understand that their patients and team members rely on them to provide the best possible care and promote optimal outcomes for patients. In doing so, they learn to be dependable people you can count on when you need them most.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Are You Looking to Put Your Nursing Skills and Qualities to Work?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you searching for a travel nursing assignment that fits your skills and qualifications?

In fact, travel nurse housing is usually the very first detail a nurse will request when looking at options for [travel nursing assignments](\/travel-nursing-jobs\/).\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a first-time travel nurse or a seasoned travel nursing veteran, one decision can literally make or break an assignment, and that is the housing arrangement.\r\n\r\nTraditionally speaking, registered nurses who travel would often just take the housing options provided by the [travel nursing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/). Nowadays, travel nurses are exercising more control over their living arrangements while on assignment and are choosing to take the monetary housing stipend and make their own choices when it comes to where to stay. If you\u2019re one of the thousands of travel nurses who have been stuck in subpar living conditions for 13 weeks, you already know why! Furthermore, the registered nurse is able to pocket the remaining tax-free stipend dollars, which enforces the importance of taking an active role in choosing your travel nurse housing.\r\n\r\nWhen you decide to take the travel nursing housing stipend, it can become laborsome and tiring to search for suitable temporary housing for travel nurses. Looking for short-term housing that is furnished, provides utilities, and might even need to be pet-friendly can really narrow your options for travel nurse housing. Here are five [travel nursing tips](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/tag\/travel-nursing-tips\/) to help you choose the right travel nurse housing for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Consider the Temporary Housing Offered by Your Travel Nurse Agency\r\n\r\nWhile you may already have your mind made up that you want to take the travel nurse housing stipend and find your own arrangements, you should first consider what\u2019s being offered by your travel nursing agency. Oftentimes, travel nursing agencies have arrangements already made with specific housing complexes that enable them to give you options that would be far more expensive if you were to pay for it on your own.\r\n\r\nEvery location is different, but some of the company-provided travel nurse housing options include secure gated neighborhoods with amenities on site such as gyms, pools, etc. Plus, these travel nurse housing options are already equipped with the things you will need for daily living, including the cooking utensils, bedding, and so on. Furthermore, if you are going to be working in a city with a high rate of crime, you might want to consider the security offered by the company-provided travel nurse housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Beware of Offers that Seem \u201cToo Good to Be True\u201d on Craigslist\r\n\r\nBecause they usually are! When searching for temporary housing for travel nurses, you might come across some real gems on Craigslist, that just seem too good to be true. While Craigslist is a valuable place to buy and sell, the platform is riddled with scammers and often ads that just aren\u2019t even real! If you find an ad for affordable housing that seems just too good to be true, it might be. Proceed with extreme caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Use Vacation Rental Websites to Find Travel Nurse Housing\r\n\r\nWebsites such as [Airbnb](https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/) and [HomeAway](https:\/\/www.homeaway.com) are great places for travel nurses to find the temporary housing options they need for an upcoming travel nurse assignment. Because these sites are intended for vacationers, the rentals you will find will almost always come completely furnished down to the pots and pans!\r\n\r\nPlus, there are a lot of safety checks in place when using these sites and the landlords must abide by strict guidelines to post their vacancies. Feedback by other people is provided and you can usually get a pretty good feel for a rental before visiting in person based on the testimonials of other guests. The prices offered on these sites are competitive and you can often strike a deal and get into a place for less than the listed price.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Consider Using Extended Stay Hotels\r\n\r\nAt first, this idea might sound a little off-putting, but extended-stay hotels make a great option for travel nurses and are often used as a bridge between traditional housing. A lot of travel nurses love the amenities provided by hotels, such as the housekeeping, breakfast, and fitness centers! It certainly makes it a lot easier to have your room made up and cleaned for you every day while you\u2019re on an assignment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these extended stay hotels often allow pets up to 60 pounds. You will also find that they offer a small kitchen area in most cases so that you can save money by preparing your own meals, even though you\u2019re staying in a hotel. There\u2019s also more flexibility in booking a hotel rather than renting out an apartment for a set time.\r\n\r\nThe standard length for most travel nursing contracts is 13-week, but that is not always the case. Many travel nurses, such as those who work in the IT implementation sector or strike nursing, will only be on assignment for a few days, a couple of weeks, or just one month at a time. Keep in mind that travel nurses are also entitled to pre-negotiated rates at extended stay hotels, so be sure you ask about this beforehand to ensure you get the best possible rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. Check Out Stipend-Based Travel Nurse Housing Service with a \u201cConcierge Approach\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the past, most housing services were directed towards the vacation rental market or the corporate housing industry. Recently, however, there are new housing services that have emerged that are designed to help the stipend travel nurse secure housing.\r\n\r\n[TravelersHaven](https:\/\/www.travelershaven.com\/) is one of these new companies that cater to the unique needs of travel nurses. While they do offer other corporate housing solutions, they have lots of property owners on the platform who are marketing their housing options to travel nurses on a 13-week basis.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using this type of service is that you can help preserve your credit score. In order to be approved for a new apartment every 13 weeks, you need to have a good credit score. However, your credit score is negatively impacted by having frequent inquiries from applying for housing. Using a service like this helps to preserve your credit score because the lease is not in your name and there are only \u201csoft inquiries\u201d used for the background checks needed for this type of housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ready to Explore Travel Nursing Assignments?\r\n\r\nAre you looking for your next travel nursing assignment?

I was only there a week and I can\u2019t imagine how tiring it is to do all the time and then be mandated to work past your 12 hours!\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t the hospital just bring in travelers to help their dedicated staff instead of pushing them past the point of exhaustion? These hard-working staff members aren\u2019t asking for more money. They just want decent insurance and better staffing.\u00a0I get it.\r\n\r\nIllinois is the most recent state to try passing legislation that limits how many patients a nurse can take care of at once, which is part of an effort made by the union to eliminate the dangerous conditions. Not alone in their efforts, other state assemblies of New York, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have held recent discussions of bills written to mandate the number of patients a nurse can be assigned at any given time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Nurse Staffing Laws Show Promise, but Opposition Ensues\r\n\r\nGerard Brogan, a union official, [told Healthcare Dive](https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/states-inch-forward-on-nurse-staffing-laws\/554359\/) that the National Nurses United is \u201cmore optimistic than ever about these bills.\u201d He explains that the problem has been swelling for years and is now coming to a boiling point.\r\n\r\nThe director of labor employment relations at Penn State, Paul Clark also told Healthcare Dive that:\r\n\r\n> \u201cEvery nursing union has been active in promoting other states to pass a safe staffing law. And the issue of a national safe staffing law has been going on for years.\u201d\u200b\r\n\r\nRegardless of the obvious need for such safety legislative measures, lawmakers are pushing back. California was the first state in the country to set these mandatory staffing ratios, and lobbying associations often cite California\u2019s staffing law that enforces nurse-patient ratios as \u201cfailed\u201d and claim the benefits have yet to be proven of such measures.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Illinois Hospital Association argues that \u201cstudies indicate that one-size-fits-all nursing staffing ratios do NOT improve quality of care or patient outcomes.\u201d\u00a0Linda Aiken is the founder of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research and she rejects those claims. Aiken has helped build most of the body of work that\u2019s been done on safe staffing for nurses. She [told Healthcare Dive](https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/states-inch-forward-on-nurse-staffing-laws\/554359\/):\r\n\r\n> \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that anything with negative consequences for the public happened in California as a result of ratios or would happen in other states if ratios were adopted. No hospitals or services closed because they could not recruit enough nurses, neither patients nor taxpayers were charged more for nursing.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnly one California hospital that closed last year cited the pressures of staffing laws as the reason for their closure. In fact, hospital closures in California have been consistent with level closures experienced in other states.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Illinois Lawmaker Reintroduces Safe Staffing Bill for Nurses\r\n\r\n[A bill was reintroduced in the Illinois Congress during the first week of May](https:\/\/www.govtrack.us\/congress\/bills\/116\/hr2581) by Democratic\u00a0Illinois representative Jan Schakowsky that would effectively set mandatory levels for nurse-to-patient staffing in the hospital setting.\r\n\r\nNurses in the state of Illinois claim that the state hospital association is using similar tactics that were used by the peer association in Massachusetts last November. Illinois nurse Marti Smith told Healthcare Dive that\u00a0\u201cthey used fear with the general public and intimidation with nurses.\u201d In both instances, these hospital associations make the claim that hospitals will be forced to close if the safe staffing laws were to go into effect. Smith also claims that internally, the nurses have their \u201cclinical autonomy\u201d threatened if they do not go along with the stance of their employers.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois safe staffing law is called the [Safe Patient Limit Act](http:\/\/www.ilga.gov\/legislation\/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3585&GAID=15&DocTypeID=HB&LegId=120266&SessionID=108&GA=101), and it\u2019s gaining steam in the state and has a good chance of becoming law. Progress is moving quite quickly for this legislation and it\u2019s set to be voted on in the Democratic-majority state house before the end of May.\r\n\r\nMany of the supporters of the bill are optimistic and feel that there\u2019s a good chance of it moving onto the state Senate and eventually making its way to the desk of the governor. This piece of legislation has been modeled largely around the safe staffing laws in California, making it the second of its kind should it go into effect. The biggest difference is the fact the Illinois bill has codified rations, which California\u2019s does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Safe Staffing Laws in Massachusetts Pushed Despite 2018 Setback\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Nurse Association (MNA) continues to push for its safe staffing law, despite the failed attempt last November to pass on the ballot referendum. The voters in the state of Massachusetts then rejected the measure, however, the voters may have been confused by the question explains Joanne Spetz, a researcher at Healthforce Center at UC San Francisco. She told a publication\u00a0\u201cthat is not a state that does a lot of propositions. It\u2019s hard to say what voters were thinking about that.\u201d\r\n\r\nLeading up to the election, the bill seemed promising that it would pass, but then, just days before the vote, the state\u2019s Health Policy Commission published a claim that if the bill passed, it could potentially cost as much as $949 million per year.\r\n\r\nHowever, union nurses are skeptical of the timing and methodologies used in the study.

Once the research has been completed, the results will be used to inform the future vote on safe staffing legislation. The governor of the state has expressed an interest in signing such a bill into law, and the New York State assembly is majority-Democrat.\r\n\r\nRepublican state senator Ed McBroom of Michigan has just recently re-introduced mandatory staffing legislation for the third time \u2013 along with a twin bill \u2013 in the House.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania nurses continue to fight for the passage of mandatory safe staffing legislation. the Democratic Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, promised to sign any safe staffing legislation that makes it to his desk, but a [union coalition\u2019s legislation tracker](https:\/\/www.nursesofpa.org\/tracker\/) says the bill has a ways to go before it will ever reach the governor.\r\n\r\nAt Elite Specialty Staffing, our nurses always come first. We\u2019re hopeful that these and other efforts towards passing safe staffing legislation go into effect.

I was only there a week and I can\u2019t imagine how tiring it is to do all the time and then be mandated to work past your 12 hours!\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t the hospital just bring in travelers to help their dedicated staff instead of pushing them past the point of exhaustion? These hard-working staff members aren\u2019t asking for more money. They just want decent insurance and better staffing.\u00a0I get it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Illinois is the most recent state to try passing legislation that limits how many patients a nurse can take care of at once, which is part of an effort made by the union to eliminate the dangerous conditions. Not alone in their efforts, other state assemblies of New York, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have held recent discussions of bills written to mandate the number of patients a nurse can be assigned at any given time.<\/p>\n<h2>Nurse Staffing Laws Show Promise, but Opposition Ensues<\/h2>\n<p>Gerard Brogan, a union official, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/states-inch-forward-on-nurse-staffing-laws\/554359\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told Healthcare Dive<\/a> that the National Nurses United is &#8220;more optimistic than ever about these bills.&#8221; He explains that the problem has been swelling for years and is now coming to a boiling point.<\/p>\n<p>The director of labor employment relations at Penn State, Paul Clark also told Healthcare Dive that:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every nursing union has been active in promoting other states to pass a safe staffing law. And the issue of a national safe staffing law has been going on for years.&#8221;\u200b<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Regardless of the obvious need for such safety legislative measures, lawmakers are pushing back. California was the first state in the country to set these mandatory staffing ratios, and lobbying associations often cite California&#8217;s staffing law that enforces nurse-patient ratios as &#8220;failed&#8221; and claim the benefits have yet to be proven of such measures.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the Illinois Hospital Association argues that &#8220;studies indicate that one-size-fits-all nursing staffing ratios do NOT improve quality of care or patient outcomes.&#8221;\u00a0Linda Aiken is the founder of the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research and she rejects those claims. Aiken has helped build most of the body of work that&#8217;s been done on safe staffing for nurses. She <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/states-inch-forward-on-nurse-staffing-laws\/554359\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told Healthcare Dive<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is absolutely no evidence that anything with negative consequences for the public happened in California as a result of ratios or would happen in other states if ratios were adopted. No hospitals or services closed because they could not recruit enough nurses, neither patients nor taxpayers were charged more for nursing.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Only one California hospital that closed last year cited the pressures of staffing laws as the reason for their closure. In fact, hospital closures in California have been consistent with level closures experienced in other states.<\/p>\n<h2>Illinois Lawmaker Reintroduces Safe Staffing Bill for Nurses<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.govtrack.us\/congress\/bills\/116\/hr2581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A bill was reintroduced in the Illinois Congress during the first week of May<\/a> by Democratic\u00a0Illinois representative Jan Schakowsky that would effectively set mandatory levels for nurse-to-patient staffing in the hospital setting.<\/p>\n<p>Nurses in the state of Illinois claim that the state hospital association is using similar tactics that were used by the peer association in Massachusetts last November. Illinois nurse Marti Smith told Healthcare Dive that\u00a0&#8220;they used fear with the general public and intimidation with nurses.&#8221; In both instances, these hospital associations make the claim that hospitals will be forced to close if the safe staffing laws were to go into effect. Smith also claims that internally, the nurses have their &#8220;clinical autonomy&#8221; threatened if they do not go along with the stance of their employers.<\/p>\n<p>The Illinois safe staffing law is called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilga.gov\/legislation\/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3585&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=120266&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Safe Patient Limit Act<\/a>, and it&#8217;s gaining steam in the state and has a good chance of becoming law. Progress is moving quite quickly for this legislation and it&#8217;s set to be voted on in the Democratic-majority state house before the end of May.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the supporters of the bill are optimistic and feel that there&#8217;s a good chance of it moving onto the state Senate and eventually making its way to the desk of the governor. This piece of legislation has been modeled largely around the safe staffing laws in California, making it the second of its kind should it go into effect. The biggest difference is the fact the Illinois bill has codified rations, which California&#8217;s does not.<\/p>\n<h2>Safe Staffing Laws in Massachusetts Pushed Despite 2018 Setback<\/h2>\n<p>The Massachusetts Nurse Association (MNA) continues to push for its safe staffing law, despite the failed attempt last November to pass on the ballot referendum. The voters in the state of Massachusetts then rejected the measure, however, the voters may have been confused by the question explains Joanne Spetz, a researcher at Healthforce Center at UC San Francisco. She told a publication\u00a0&#8220;that is not a state that does a lot of propositions. It&#8217;s hard to say what voters were thinking about that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Leading up to the election, the bill seemed promising that it would pass, but then, just days before the vote, the state&#8217;s Health Policy Commission published a claim that if the bill passed, it could potentially cost as much as $949 million per year.<\/p>\n<p>However, union nurses are skeptical of the timing and methodologies used in the study. The MNA recently conducted a survey of both union and non-union nurses who agreed that the hospital industry&#8217;s campaign strategy they implemented last fall was largely &#8220;inappropriate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Safe Nurse Staffing Legislation in Other States<\/h2>\n<p>New York State has recently commissioned a study that will take a deeper look at staffing ratios.

Projections show that California will experience the greatest growth in their need for travel nurses in upcoming years, but that all states will experience employment growth in this division.\r\n\r\nTravel nurses are hired by [staffing agencies for nurses](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/) to help fill in these employment gaps. Traveling medical jobs are more abundant during certain times of the year, such as flu season or during the holidays when staff members take time off for vacation.

Long answer, [travel nursing assignments](\/jobs) are available throughout the nation, but the location of these particular [travel nursing jobs](\/travel-nursing-jobs) will vary based on the fluctuating needs of a hospital or healthcare facility. At the end of the day, you are in control of choosing where you want to go as a travel nurse. If your dream location is not currently presenting any opportunities, chances are that it will be in the future.\r\n\r\nOne important thing to keep in mind when looking at travel nursing jobs in various locations is the fact that you need an active license in the state where the assignment is to work it. In fact, to even apply for a travel nursing job, you often need to have this licensing completed.

One of the many perks of being a travel nurse is that you get to decide when you want to work and you can take time off in between contracts if you so choose.<\/p>\n[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;Where can Travel Nurses Go?&#8221; open_toggle_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; open_toggle_background_color=&#8221;#f1f1f1&#8243; closed_toggle_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; closed_toggle_background_color=&#8221;#f1f1f1&#8243; icon_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;question2&#8243; module_class=&#8221;faqs&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25.4&#8243; title_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; title_font=&#8221;Open Sans||||||||&#8221; title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; closed_title_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; closed_title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; body_font=&#8221;Open Sans||||&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;#666666&#8243; body_font_size=&#8221;16px&#8221; body_line_height=&#8221;1.6em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; border_width_all=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; border_color_all=&#8221;#eee&#8221; border_style_all=&#8221;solid&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px||true&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;13.5px|10px|13.5px|10px|true|true&#8221; title_font_size_tablet=&#8221;18&#8243; title_font_size_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; custom_css_toggle_icon=&#8221;font-size:20px;||&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;on&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#f7f7f7&#8243; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<p>Short answer: anywhere there\u2019s a staffing need for nurses.

Keep in mind that there may be restrictions in regard to the weight and breed of your pet. <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/10-travel-nursing-tips-for-bringing-pets-with-you-to-an-assignment\/\">Learn more about traveling with pets to a nursing assignment.<\/a><\/p>[\/et_pb_toggle][et_pb_toggle title=&#8221;Can I Travel with Another Travel Nurse?&#8221; open_toggle_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; open_toggle_background_color=&#8221;#f1f1f1&#8243; closed_toggle_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; closed_toggle_background_color=&#8221;#f1f1f1&#8243; icon_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;question10&#8243; module_class=&#8221;faqs&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25.4&#8243; title_text_color=&#8221;#000000&#8243; title_font=&#8221;Open Sans||||||||&#8221; title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; closed_title_font=&#8221;||||||||&#8221; closed_title_font_size=&#8221;18px&#8221; body_font=&#8221;Open Sans||||&#8221; body_text_color=&#8221;#666666&#8243; body_font_size=&#8221;16px&#8221; body_line_height=&#8221;1.6em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; border_width_all=&#8221;0.5px&#8221; border_color_all=&#8221;#eee&#8221; border_style_all=&#8221;solid&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px||true&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;13.5px|10px|13.5px|10px|true|true&#8221; title_font_size_tablet=&#8221;18&#8243; title_font_size_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; custom_css_toggle_icon=&#8221;font-size:20px;||&#8221; use_border_color=&#8221;on&#8221; border_color=&#8221;#f7f7f7&#8243; border_style=&#8221;solid&#8221;]<p>Yes.

Top pay. Versatile locations. If you are one of the many registered nurses considering working for a per diem travel nursing agency \u2013 we\u2019ve compiled a list of five per diem nursing benefits to help you know what to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Per Diem Nursing?\r\n\r\nThe name \u201cper diem\u201d in Latin literally translates to \u201cby the day\u201d. In the case of registered nurses, it often means \u201cby the shift\u201d. A registered nurse who works per diem is offered a shift or several shifts usually by a nursing staffing agency, and the RN can either accept or turn down the offered work hours.\r\n\r\nYou may already realize the perks of being a travel nurse, but there are unique per diem nursing benefits you might not be aware of. If you decide to pursue a per diem nursing career, you will benefit from new experiences, income opportunities, and professional growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Five Per Diem Nursing Benefits\r\n\r\nWhat are the benefits of per diem nursing? Keep reading as we name the top five perks of being a per diem nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Enjoy Highly Competitive Wages\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most well-known per diem nursing benefits is the high pay rates. Typically, a nurse working per diem is going to receive a much higher hourly rate than a full-time registered nurse working in the same setting.\r\n\r\nThe average registered nurse salary for a full-time RN is $73,550 according to data from the [Nurse Salary Guide](https:\/\/nursesalaryguide.net\/registered-nurse-rn-salary\/). A per diem registered nurse can make as much as $100,000 annually.\r\n\r\nEvery nursing staffing agency and every hospital has their own pay rates, so this rate is literally just scratching the surface of possibilities when it comes to per diem nursing pay rates. For instance, did you catch the [story of the per diem nurse that\u2019s gone viral who earned $19K in only two weeks](https:\/\/nurse.org\/articles\/highest-per-diem-pay-for-nurses-in-california\/) picking up per diem shifts in California? Yes, $19K in two weeks. Let that one sink in for a minute.\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse myself, I have picked up many shifts on a per diem basis working in Ohio. While pay rates for registered nurses in the Midwest are not nearly as impressive as what this nurse made in California, on average I would make about $10 an hour more than the staff nurses at the same hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. You Have Complete Control of Your Schedule\r\n\r\nNo matter what profession you choose to go into, your schedule and how much control you are able to exert over that schedule is a huge factor when it comes to your choice of career. Per diem nurses often choose this line of work because of the flexible schedules.\r\n\r\nWork when you want. Work where you want. Your per diem travel nursing agency will offer you a shift, or a series of shifts, and you have the power to either accept or decline the work. If you want to take more time off during the holidays, you can. Conversely, if you want to bank some of the sweet pay benefits that are offered during the holidays, you can do that too!\r\n\r\nWhen I worked as a per diem nurse, I would always take the available holiday shifts that offered double time pay rates. Because your pay rate working per diem is already high, the double time is even sweeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Enjoy Tax-Free Benefits and Reimbursements\r\n\r\nWhile there are many per diem nursing benefits, the tax breaks are some of the best perks of this type of career. Some of these professional benefits which are tax deductible include:\r\n\r\n- Cost of uniforms, including laundry and dry cleaning expenses\r\n- Malpractice insurance\r\n- Phone, internet, computer-related expenses related to your job (which also includes warranties, apps, and software)\r\n- Professional licensing costs\r\n- Cost for continuing education (including books)\r\n- Costs related to your job searches\r\n- Trade literature costs\r\n\r\nA per diem nurse salary is already higher than a full-time nurse\u2019s salary. When tax time rolls around, you can see how these tax breaks and deductions can quickly add up to a generous income.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. You Develop Cultural Competence\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest adjustments when it comes to per diem and travel nursing is doing your job in new places all the time. When working as a per diem nurse, you might not be creating a consistent relationship with your patients or coworkers, but you will develop what is known as cultural competence. This term \u201ccultural competence\u201d references the ability to navigate yourself in new environments and settings, around new people, in order to provide the best possible care for your patients.\r\n\r\nPer diem nurses often work in different hospitals and settings. As such, you will learn how to adjust to new locations and demographics quickly, which will improve your ability to communicate, connect, and interact with no people seamlessly, with minimal tension and difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. You Can Learn Multiple Specialties\r\n\r\nAs a per diem nurse who works in multiple facilities, you will be given opportunities to work alongside colleagues in a variety of specialties. You are able to learn and grow in these positions and you will often work as a float nurse who works on different units.

Top pay. Versatile locations. If you are one of the many registered nurses considering working for a per diem travel nursing agency &#8211; we&#8217;ve compiled a list of five per diem nursing benefits to help you know what to expect.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Per Diem Nursing?<\/h2>\n<p>The name &#8220;per diem&#8221; in Latin literally translates to &#8220;by the day&#8221;. In the case of registered nurses, it often means &#8220;by the shift&#8221;. A registered nurse who works per diem is offered a shift or several shifts usually by a nursing staffing agency, and the RN can either accept or turn down the offered work hours.<\/p>\n<p>You may already realize the perks of being a travel nurse, but there are unique per diem nursing benefits you might not be aware of. If you decide to pursue a per diem nursing career, you will benefit from new experiences, income opportunities, and professional growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Five Per Diem Nursing Benefits<\/h2>\n<p>What are the benefits of per diem nursing? Keep reading as we name the top five perks of being a per diem nurse.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Enjoy Highly Competitive Wages<\/h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most well-known per diem nursing benefits is the high pay rates. Typically, a nurse working per diem is going to receive a much higher hourly rate than a full-time registered nurse working in the same setting.<\/p>\n<p>The average registered nurse salary for a full-time RN is $73,550 according to data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/nursesalaryguide.net\/registered-nurse-rn-salary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nurse Salary Guide<\/a>. A per diem registered nurse can make as much as $100,000 annually.<\/p>\n<p>Every nursing staffing agency and every hospital has their own pay rates, so this rate is literally just scratching the surface of possibilities when it comes to per diem nursing pay rates. For instance, did you catch the <a href=\"https:\/\/nurse.org\/articles\/highest-per-diem-pay-for-nurses-in-california\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">story of the per diem nurse that&#8217;s gone viral who earned $19K in only two weeks<\/a> picking up per diem shifts in California? Yes, $19K in two weeks. Let that one sink in for a minute.<\/p>\n<p>As a travel nurse myself, I have picked up many shifts on a per diem basis working in Ohio. While pay rates for registered nurses in the Midwest are not nearly as impressive as what this nurse made in California, on average I would make about $10 an hour more than the staff nurses at the same hospitals.<\/p>\n<h2>2. You Have Complete Control of Your Schedule<\/h2>\n<p>No matter what profession you choose to go into, your schedule and how much control you are able to exert over that schedule is a huge factor when it comes to your choice of career. Per diem nurses often choose this line of work because of the flexible schedules.<\/p>\n<p>Work when you want. Work where you want. Your per diem travel nursing agency will offer you a shift, or a series of shifts, and you have the power to either accept or decline the work. If you want to take more time off during the holidays, you can. Conversely, if you want to bank some of the sweet pay benefits that are offered during the holidays, you can do that too!<\/p>\n<p>When I worked as a per diem nurse, I would always take the available holiday shifts that offered double time pay rates. Because your pay rate working per diem is already high, the double time is even sweeter.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Enjoy Tax-Free Benefits and Reimbursements<\/h2>\n<p>While there are many per diem nursing benefits, the tax breaks are some of the best perks of this type of career. Some of these professional benefits which are tax deductible include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost of uniforms, including laundry and dry cleaning expenses<\/li>\n<li>Malpractice insurance<\/li>\n<li>Phone, internet, computer-related expenses related to your job (which also includes warranties, apps, and software)<\/li>\n<li>Professional licensing costs<\/li>\n<li>Cost for continuing education (including books)<\/li>\n<li>Costs related to your job searches<\/li>\n<li>Trade literature costs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A per diem nurse salary is already higher than a full-time nurse&#8217;s salary. When tax time rolls around, you can see how these tax breaks and deductions can quickly add up to a generous income.<\/p>\n<h2>4. You Develop Cultural Competence<\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest adjustments when it comes to per diem and travel nursing is doing your job in new places all the time. When working as a per diem nurse, you might not be creating a consistent relationship with your patients or coworkers, but you will develop what is known as cultural competence. This term &#8220;cultural competence&#8221; references the ability to navigate yourself in new environments and settings, around new people, in order to provide the best possible care for your patients.<\/p>\n<p>Per diem nurses often work in different hospitals and settings. As such, you will learn how to adjust to new locations and demographics quickly, which will improve your ability to communicate, connect, and interact with no people seamlessly, with minimal tension and difficulty.<\/p>\n<h2>5. You Can Learn Multiple Specialties<\/h2>\n<p>As a per diem nurse who works in multiple facilities, you will be given opportunities to work alongside colleagues in a variety of specialties. You are able to learn and grow in these positions and you will often work as a float nurse who works on different units. You will help the other nurses on the floor and take patients as appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>By making strategic decisions when it comes to the assignments you choose to take on, you can hone your skills in one or more specialties, which makes you highly valuable to employers.<\/p>\n<h2>Are You Ready to Work with a Per Diem Travel Nursing Agency?<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that some nursing staffing agencies will also offer healthcare and other benefits to per diem travel nurses?

You may be surprised to learn that you can, in fact, take on a local travel nursing assignment, but the number of benefits and pay may be less than if you were working on an assignment further away from home.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re going to review the main considerations about working as a local travel nurse, and also the pros and cons of travel nursing close to home.\r\n\r\nIf you want to [become a travel nurse](\/2019-the-year-to-be-a-travel-nurse\/), but are still a little bit hesitant about traveling so far away from home to take on a contract nursing assignment in another state, or perhaps you have many obligations to your home and you\u2019re not able to travel too far away for an extended period of time, you might want to consider choosing a travel nursing assignment that\u2019s not too far away. First thing you need to understand is, how close, is too close?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking the Myth about the 50-Mile Radius\r\n\r\nYou may have heard that you must live outside of a 50-, 60-, or 100-mile radius in order to receive benefits of travel nursing on a travel nursing assignment at a local hospital. While this assumption is partially true, there\u2019s also a big myth that the IRS has some sort of \u201c50-mile radius rule\u201d that describes the distance you have to be away from a travel nursing assignment to work it. This is simply not true.\r\n\r\nHowever, many hospitals and facilities have their own specific mile radius rule in place that is used as a general thumb in order to prevent staff nurses from picking up travel contracts to their own facility that typically ranges between a 40 and 200 miles distance from the facility. That being said, every assignment is unique and each hospital has its own specific requirements. If you\u2019re interested in a travel nursing contract close to home, be sure you talk with an experienced travel nursing recruiter, to find out the specific details of the assignment close to you and how far away you must live in order to get the full benefits package. Check out our earlier blog post for more travel nursing advice on [how to choose a travel nursing recruiter](\/5-tips-to-choose-the-right-travel-nurse-recruiter\/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Travel Nursing Close to Home Tax Deduction Considerations\r\n\r\nSo yes! You can be a travel nurse without spending a small fortune on flights or traveling across the country for a travel nursing assignment. You are still entitled to tax-free housing stipends (as long as you are within the correct mile radius for that facility), and other benefits when you work a local travel nursing contract.\r\n\r\nWhile you may be able to get the benefits of travel nursing at a location nearby, understand that the IRS does have laws in place that require you to maintain a temporary residence in order to qualify for the tax-free housing supplements. For more specific information on tax stipends, we advise you to consult a tax professional in your area who can advise you on the specific laws in your state regarding local nursing contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros to Travel Nursing Close to Home\r\n\r\n- Lower out-of-pocket expenses\r\n- You can possibly even keep your day job and make a ton of money on the side\r\n- No worries about furnishing a place or a bunch of luggage and packing\r\n- A short drive still brings you home\r\n- Because you\u2019re more familiar with the area, you will have an easier time finding the right hotel or apartment\r\n- You won\u2019t have to miss out on a family function unless you want to, of course, you will still have a legit excuse!\r\n- Fewer feelings of homesickness\r\n- There\u2019s security in having your friends and family nearby\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cons to Travel Nursing Close to Home\r\n\r\n- You don\u2019t get to see new places across the country\r\n- Your options for travel nursing contracts will be drastically narrowed\r\n- You won\u2019t experience unique and different patient populations\r\n- All in all, you\u2019re working a job with a longer commute and maintaining two living locations\r\n- You still have to set up housing arrangements\r\n- You won\u2019t experience the stereotypical life of a travel nurse\r\n\r\n\r\n## Stay Flexible for More Travel Nursing Assignment Opportunities\r\n\r\nDepending on the region in the United States you live, you might not be able to find ample opportunities for [travel nursing jobs](\/travel-nursing-jobs\/) in your specialty. Also, it may take some time for one to become available. Furthermore, when these positions do become available, you might not have as much choice about the schedule or accommodations as you would in a location or facility with more needs. Another option you can explore is picking up [per diem nursing jobs](\/per-diem-nursing-jobs\/) locally, while you wait on the right travel nursing contract close to home to open up.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to travel further away from home, you will leave yourself open to a wider variety of travel nursing jobs and more adventure to boot! If you want to make special requests about your scheduling or accommodations, be sure to bring this up to your travel nurse recruiter during the interview stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Keep Your Mind Open to the Vast World of Opportunities as a Travel Nurse\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse myself, I whole-heartedly feel that the assignments that require you to go to a completely new location are one of the most rewarding parts of the jobs. Meeting new people. Seeing new places. Touching lives. Helping patients. For me, the joy of facing the unknown is my cup of tea all day long, but this is not true for everyone.\r\n\r\nQuite often, a travel nurse new to the industry might want to \u201ctest the waters\u201d before they actually commit to a travel nursing assignment. Other times, a travel nurse might have family or obligations at home that require them to stay as close to home as possible while they work as a travel nurse.\r\n\r\nAll of these considerations being said, this brings us to the one thing that unites all nurses in the world of travel nursing \u2013 freedom. It\u2019s your choice if you want to work far away or stay close to home. Think about what matters most to you.

As a staff nurse, you can only take a small amount of vacation each year, so one perk is to be able to travel to new areas and explore on my days off!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Two:** How do you like working at facilities on a short-term basis?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Two:**\u00a0I don\u2019t have to worry about the politics involved when working for a hospital per diem or on a travel contract. I just go, ask how they do things and take care of my patients. I\u2019m not there to try to change anything, just help them through and be a good team player.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[![Header-photos-for-Eleven-travel-nursing-questions-answered-by-an-experienced-travel-nurse-with-per-diem-registered-nursing-experience](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/60524465_2261283790631655_5554762155460395008_n.jpg)](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/apply)\r\n\r\n#### **Question Three:** What did you choose for the housing accommodations?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Three:**\u00a0I always choose to take the stipends and find my own housing. I like to be able to research the area and research reviews from other people before I decide where to stay. I look for a clean, safe neighborhood and near the hospital and near fun things to do.\u00a0Also if I am able to find housing below my stipend amount then I can keep the difference as income.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Four:** Did you have any advice for [nurses traveling with pets](\/10-travel-nursing-tips-for-bringing-pets-with-you-to-an-assignment\/) or family?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Four:** We brought our pets to California with us this past winter and it was the first time to bring them. We drove from Ohio to California and they actually did well. I made sure they had vet checkups and all the shots were up to date and had them give me copies of their complete records. We brought a dog and two cats. I researched along the way pet-friendly hotels. We made stops to give them potty breaks and time to eat.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Five:** How do you like [per diem nursing](\/per-diem-nursing-jobs\/) compared to [travel nursing contracts](\/travel-nursing-jobs\/)?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Five:**\u00a0Per diem nursing contracts are nice too because they are close to home and I can pick up only when I want and not be committed to three 12-hour shifts per week.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Six:** What do you look for when choosing a travel nursing agency?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Six:** Insurance can be a big issue when traveling. In my early years, I traveled near home so my husband could still work his full-time job and carry our medical insurance. As he began to travel with me, we lost that option. We chose to buy our own private medical insurance through a broker and we pay a premium every month. I went this route because if you take travel company medical insurance, it is canceled around 20 days after your contract is finished. This is fine if you plan to start a new contract within that time and your insurance won\u2019t lapse. I sometimes like to take longer or do something different and didn\u2019t want to find ourselves without medical coverage.\u00a0Different travel companies offer good or not so good insurance too. I actually just decided to try out the insurance with my current company. I\u2019m very happy with my current travel nursing agency and I love my recruiter so I don\u2019t see myself changing companies any time soon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Seven:** Has travel nursing opened new doors or changed your lifestyle?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Seven:**\u00a0I love, love, love travel nursing! I have met so many people and I learned to be a nurse who can just jump into a new place and go!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n#### **Question Eight:** What kind of impact do your travel nursing agency and recruiter have on your assignment?\r\n\r\n- **Answer Eight:**\u00a0With traveling, your company and recruiter really have a huge impact on your overall experience.

As a staff nurse, you can only take a small amount of vacation each year, so one perk is to be able to travel to new areas and explore on my days off!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Two:<\/strong> How do you like working at facilities on a short-term basis?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Two:<\/strong>&nbsp;I don\u2019t have to worry about the politics involved when working for a hospital per diem or on a travel contract. I just go, ask how they do things and take care of my patients. I\u2019m not there to try to change anything, just help them through and be a good team player.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/apply\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-25560 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/60524465_2261283790631655_5554762155460395008_n.jpg\" alt=\"Header-photos-for-Eleven-travel-nursing-questions-answered-by-an-experienced-travel-nurse-with-per-diem-registered-nursing-experience\" width=\"352\" height=\"480\" title = '' description = '' \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Three:<\/strong> What did you choose for the housing accommodations?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Three:<\/strong>&nbsp;I always choose to take the stipends and find my own housing. I like to be able to research the area and research reviews from other people before I decide where to stay. I look for a clean, safe neighborhood and near the hospital and near fun things to do.&nbsp;Also if I am able to find housing below my stipend amount then I can keep the difference as income.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Four:<\/strong> Did you have any advice for <a href=\"\/10-travel-nursing-tips-for-bringing-pets-with-you-to-an-assignment\/\">nurses traveling with pets<\/a> or family?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Four:<\/strong> We brought our pets to California with us this past winter and it was the first time to bring them. We drove from Ohio to California and they actually did well. I made sure they had vet checkups and all the shots were up to date and had them give me copies of their complete records. We brought a dog and two cats. I researched along the way pet-friendly hotels. We made stops to give them potty breaks and time to eat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Five:<\/strong> How do you like <a href=\"\/per-diem-nursing-jobs\/\">per diem nursing<\/a> compared to <a href=\"\/travel-nursing-jobs\/\">travel nursing contracts<\/a>?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Five:<\/strong>&nbsp;Per diem nursing contracts are nice too because they are close to home and I can pick up only when I want and not be committed to three 12-hour shifts per week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Six:<\/strong> What do you look for when choosing a travel nursing agency?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Six:<\/strong> Insurance can be a big issue when traveling. In my early years, I traveled near home so my husband could still work his full-time job and carry our medical insurance. As he began to travel with me, we lost that option. We chose to buy our own private medical insurance through a broker and we pay a premium every month. I went this route because if you take travel company medical insurance, it is canceled around 20 days after your contract is finished. This is fine if you plan to start a new contract within that time and your insurance won\u2019t lapse. I sometimes like to take longer or do something different and didn\u2019t want to find ourselves without medical coverage.&nbsp;Different travel companies offer good or not so good insurance too. I actually just decided to try out the insurance with my current company. I\u2019m very happy with my current travel nursing agency and I love my recruiter so I don\u2019t see myself changing companies any time soon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Seven:<\/strong> Has travel nursing opened new doors or changed your lifestyle?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Seven:<\/strong>&nbsp;I love, love, love travel nursing! I have met so many people and I learned to be a nurse who can just jump into a new place and go!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question Eight:<\/strong> What kind of impact do your travel nursing agency and recruiter have on your assignment?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Answer Eight:<\/strong>&nbsp;With traveling, your company and recruiter really have a huge impact on your overall experience. I\u2019ve worked with six companies and this one offers its nurses everything from bonuses, free continuing education units (CEUs), reimbursement for anything you need to do your job, great benefits, but they also treat you like they care about you!

Are you a skilled registered nurse with expertise in your field? Are you adaptable? If any of this resonates with you, you might want to be a travel nurse.\r\n\r\nIn fact, you might already want to become a travel nurse, which is why you\u2019re here at our blog today. We\u2019re going to review the history of travel nurses, the current need for travel nurses across the United States, and the travel nurse industry projected growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n## History of the Travel Nursing Industry\r\n\r\nFor more than four decades, travel nurses have been sent to various regions in the nation during times of patient influx to help hospitals and healthcare centers meet staffing needs. The very first travel nurses on record were contracted in New Orleans during the 1970s to help during the influx of visitors for Mardi Gras, according to [TravelNursing.org](https:\/\/www.travelnursing.org\/history-of-travel-nursing\/). During this time, hiring travel nurses for a few weeks helped deal with the increase of visitors to the area.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, the concept of travel nursing took off in a widespread fashion as a temporary solution to the national nursing shortage as described by the [American Society of Registered Nurses](http:\/\/www.asrn.org\/journal-american-nursing-review\/633-give-travel-nursing-a-try.html). Growth of the travel nursing industry took off, and new travel nursing agencies began opening all over the United States to help place registered nurses in short-term work contracts nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fulfilling the needs caused by the nursing shortage, travel nurses also gained popularity as a solution to the seasonal demands throughout the nation in areas that attracted large numbers of retired people and travelers in the winter time, like Arizona and Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Digital Era Led to More [Travel Nursing Jobs](\/travel-nursing-jobs\/)\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, the national nursing shortage has not gone away, rather it\u2019s grown. In addition to this factor and the need for seasonal nurses for movement of people during specific times of the year, internet and the growth of mobile technology have furthered the growth of the travel nursing industry.\r\n\r\nAdvancements made possible during this digital age have made it easier for nurses to travel across the country to [work as a travel nurse](\/2019-the-year-to-be-a-travel-nurse\/), while still maintaining their connections to a home base. Furthermore, registered nurses use the internet to find more opportunities and the highest paying travel nursing jobs and make more connections in the industry, while travel nursing agencies are more able to reach out and connect with nurses who are looking for short-term staffing assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Aging Baby Boomers Continue to Soar the Demand for Healthcare Services\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most obvious reasons the need for travel nurses continues to grow is the fact we have an enormous population of people aging in the United States. As people experience longer life spans, the demand for healthcare services, in general, continues to rise. According to the [National Institute of Nursing Research](https:\/\/www.ninr.nih.gov\/sites\/www.ninr.nih.gov\/files\/DrGradyNOGeriatricNursingJuly20112.pdf), about 80 percent of people who are over the age of 65 have at least one illness that is chronic in nature, such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Many of these individuals have multiple chronic illnesses simultaneously.\r\n\r\nChanging demographics have led to more professional and independent nurses who are able to fill in the gaps when nursing staffing agencies and hospitals are short and need more skilled nurses in order to keep up.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How the Affordable Care Act Led to a Higher Demand for Travel Nurses\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Affordable Care Act is probably the single most contributing factor to the growth of the travel nursing industry. Since 2014, it\u2019s estimated that an additional eight million people have signed up for health insurance since 2014. [Kaiser Health News reports](http:\/\/khn.org\/news\/improved-economy-obamacare-boost-demand-for-travel-nurses-2\/) that the travel nursing industry has hit a 20-year high as a direct result of this increase in insured Americans.\r\n\r\nThrow all these factors together along with the regulatory changes and improving the economy, and you can see why travel nursing is here to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What Does the Future of the Travel Nursing Industry Look Like?\r\n\r\nAccording to an article published by Reuters:\r\n\r\n> \u201cIndustry experts, from hospital associations to Wall Street analysts, say the crisis is harder to address than in the past. A faculty shortage and too few nursing school slots has contributed to the problem. Hospitals seek to meet a goal calling for 80 percent of nursing staff to have a four-year degree by 2020, up from 50 percent in 2010. They also face more competition with clinics and insurance companies that may offer more flexible hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven though the national shortage of registered nurses has persisted for decades, the industry experts do not predict it\u2019s going to end any time soon. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that the need for travel nurses is going to get worse and greater in the coming decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that there will be 1.2 million vacancies for registered nursing jobs from 2014 until 2022. Older nurses are retiring and with fewer nurses in the pool already, something will have to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Now is the Perfect Time to Become a Travel Nurse\r\n\r\nPatients around the United States are in desperate need of your nursing skills and expertise.

In fact, travel nurse housing is usually the very first detail a nurse will request when looking at options for [travel nursing assignments](\/travel-nursing-jobs\/).\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a first-time travel nurse or a seasoned travel nursing veteran, one decision can literally make or break an assignment, and that is the housing arrangement.\r\n\r\nTraditionally speaking, registered nurses who travel would often just take the housing options provided by the [travel nursing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/). Nowadays, travel nurses are exercising more control over their living arrangements while on assignment and are choosing to take the monetary housing stipend and make their own choices when it comes to where to stay. If you\u2019re one of the thousands of travel nurses who have been stuck in subpar living conditions for 13 weeks, you already know why! Furthermore, the registered nurse is able to pocket the remaining tax-free stipend dollars, which enforces the importance of taking an active role in choosing your travel nurse housing.\r\n\r\nWhen you decide to take the travel nursing housing stipend, it can become laborsome and tiring to search for suitable temporary housing for travel nurses. Looking for short-term housing that is furnished, provides utilities, and might even need to be pet-friendly can really narrow your options for travel nurse housing. Here are five [travel nursing tips](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/tag\/travel-nursing-tips\/) to help you choose the right travel nurse housing for you.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Consider the Temporary Housing Offered by Your Travel Nurse Agency\r\n\r\nWhile you may already have your mind made up that you want to take the travel nurse housing stipend and find your own arrangements, you should first consider what\u2019s being offered by your travel nursing agency. Oftentimes, travel nursing agencies have arrangements already made with specific housing complexes that enable them to give you options that would be far more expensive if you were to pay for it on your own.\r\n\r\nEvery location is different, but some of the company-provided travel nurse housing options include secure gated neighborhoods with amenities on site such as gyms, pools, etc. Plus, these travel nurse housing options are already equipped with the things you will need for daily living, including the cooking utensils, bedding, and so on. Furthermore, if you are going to be working in a city with a high rate of crime, you might want to consider the security offered by the company-provided travel nurse housing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Beware of Offers that Seem \u201cToo Good to Be True\u201d on Craigslist\r\n\r\nBecause they usually are! When searching for temporary housing for travel nurses, you might come across some real gems on Craigslist, that just seem too good to be true. While Craigslist is a valuable place to buy and sell, the platform is riddled with scammers and often ads that just aren\u2019t even real! If you find an ad for affordable housing that seems just too good to be true, it might be. Proceed with extreme caution.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Use Vacation Rental Websites to Find Travel Nurse Housing\r\n\r\nWebsites such as [Airbnb](https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/) and [HomeAway](https:\/\/www.homeaway.com) are great places for travel nurses to find the temporary housing options they need for an upcoming travel nurse assignment. Because these sites are intended for vacationers, the rentals you will find will almost always come completely furnished down to the pots and pans!\r\n\r\nPlus, there are a lot of safety checks in place when using these sites and the landlords must abide by strict guidelines to post their vacancies. Feedback by other people is provided and you can usually get a pretty good feel for a rental before visiting in person based on the testimonials of other guests. The prices offered on these sites are competitive and you can often strike a deal and get into a place for less than the listed price.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Consider Using Extended Stay Hotels\r\n\r\nAt first, this idea might sound a little off-putting, but extended-stay hotels make a great option for travel nurses and are often used as a bridge between traditional housing. A lot of travel nurses love the amenities provided by hotels, such as the housekeeping, breakfast, and fitness centers! It certainly makes it a lot easier to have your room made up and cleaned for you every day while you\u2019re on an assignment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these extended stay hotels often allow pets up to 60 pounds. You will also find that they offer a small kitchen area in most cases so that you can save money by preparing your own meals, even though you\u2019re staying in a hotel. There\u2019s also more flexibility in booking a hotel rather than renting out an apartment for a set time.\r\n\r\nThe standard length for most travel nursing contracts is 13-week, but that is not always the case. Many travel nurses, such as those who work in the IT implementation sector or strike nursing, will only be on assignment for a few days, a couple of weeks, or just one month at a time. Keep in mind that travel nurses are also entitled to pre-negotiated rates at extended stay hotels, so be sure you ask about this beforehand to ensure you get the best possible rates.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. Check Out Stipend-Based Travel Nurse Housing Service with a \u201cConcierge Approach\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the past, most housing services were directed towards the vacation rental market or the corporate housing industry. Recently, however, there are new housing services that have emerged that are designed to help the stipend travel nurse secure housing.\r\n\r\n[TravelersHaven](https:\/\/www.travelershaven.com\/) is one of these new companies that cater to the unique needs of travel nurses. While they do offer other corporate housing solutions, they have lots of property owners on the platform who are marketing their housing options to travel nurses on a 13-week basis.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using this type of service is that you can help preserve your credit score. In order to be approved for a new apartment every 13 weeks, you need to have a good credit score. However, your credit score is negatively impacted by having frequent inquiries from applying for housing. Using a service like this helps to preserve your credit score because the lease is not in your name and there are only \u201csoft inquiries\u201d used for the background checks needed for this type of housing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ready to Explore Travel Nursing Assignments?\r\n\r\nAre you looking for your next travel nursing assignment?

This is a program\u00a0developed by the\u00a0[American Nurses Credentialing Center](https:\/\/www.nursingworld.org\/ancc\/) (ANCC), which is a subsidiary of the American Nurses\u2019 Association. The study conducted at Harvard focused only on a group of hospitals which have achieved \u201cMagnet\u201d designation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background of the Magnet Recognition Program\r\n\r\nIn 1983, there was a study conducted by the American Academy of Nursing task force which evaluated which factors contributed to the shortage of nurses in a specific region and evaluated ways to improve the nursing care model. Out of this study grew the Magnet Recognition Program, which was developed by the task force who identified 14 shared similarities among the hospitals that were considered \u201chigh-performing\u201d. Later, these characteristics were organized into a five-component \u201cmagnet model\u201d framework for nursing research and practice. This framework is used as a type of roadmap for organizations who wish to achieve Magnet recognition. The five characteristics are:\r\n\r\n1. Transformational leadership that creates a vision for the future and the systems and environment for achieving it\r\n2. Structural empowerment \u2014 the policies and programs that support staff as they pursue organizational goals\r\n3. Exemplary professional practice\r\n4. Innovation\r\n5. \u201cEmpirical quality results\u201d categorized in terms of clinical outcomes related to nursing, and workforce, patient, and organizational outcomes\r\n\r\nTo this day, the Magnet Recognition Program evaluates hospitals\u2019 performance according to each of these five areas and will only give the Magnet status to the elite tier of hospitals who work hard to achieve it. Currently, only 10 percent of the hospitals in the United States have earned this designation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acute Nursing Care Models Re-imagined\r\n\r\nInnovative ideas are being used to improve the patient experience. In order to achieve such a profound impact on the delivery of healthcare, nurses and physicians need to achieve optimal performance to promote better outcomes.\r\n\r\nRelatively few hospitals achieve Magnet recognition because it typically requires a substantial investment in order to achieve it. On average, it takes a hospital somewhere between three to five years to meet the parameters needed to attain the designation. This costs the hospital an average of $500,000 annually, which comes out to an investment of approximately $2 million. While these initial costs are incredibly hefty for even top-performing healthcare systems and hospitals, the investments have shown to pay off within a few years because of the lowered personnel costs and improved patient outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Outcomes Demonstrate Correlation Between Excellent Nursing Care and Physician Performance\r\n\r\nThe Harvard study looked directly at the association between superior nursing care (as indicated by the hospital\u2019s Magnet status), the patient\u2019s satisfaction with nursing performance evaluation comments, the overall hospital scores on the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction survey, and the evaluation of the hospital within the Press Ganey\u2019s database of more than 2,000 healthcare organizations.\r\n\r\nHCAHPS is a standardized survey that collects feedback from patients on many different aspects of their care, including\u00a0nursing performance evaluation comments, hospital environment perception, food quality, and how responsive the staff is with them, including how well the nurses and doctors communicate with patients (Are they respectful? Do they offer good explanations? Do they take time and listen to concerns? Etc.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to specific questions about the care received, the patients are also asked to give an overall rating to the hospital. These ratings are referred to as \u201ctop box\u201d score \u2013 or the percentage of patients who scored the hospital superior in a specific measure. According to the [Harvard Business Review](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/how-great-nursing-improves-doctors-performance):\r\n\r\n> \u201cWe found that Magnet hospitals outperformed the non-magnet hospitals on patients\u2019 \u2018likelihood to recommend\u2019 top box scores (75.7 compared to 70.8) and we saw a similar spread on the \u2018overall rating score\u2019 (76.0 vs. 72.8). We also saw a smaller but significant difference on patient assessment of physician concern about the patient\u2019s questions or worries, which gauges courtesy and respect, listening, and explaining.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n## Magnet Status Associated with Higher Patient Ratings of Physician\u2019s Skill in Another Survey\r\n\r\nA meaningful associated was also made between the Magnet status and the patients\u2019 ratings of physicians in terms of their skills, responsiveness to concerns, time spent with the patient, courtesy, friendliness, and other measures according to results from the Press Ganey\u2019s proprietary survey.\r\n\r\nOn average, the Magnet facilities fell into a range from 84.6 percent for\u00a0\u201ctime physician spent with you\u201d to 93.2 for \u201cskill of the physician\u201d \u2013 conversely \u2013 the non-Magnet facilities ranged from 83.6 to 92.1 for the exact same questions. While the differences may seem to be subtle \u2013 they are, in fact, significant. Even a slight difference in the points of the overall score can have a dramatic effect on the percentile rank because there is a tight compression of the national scores. To put this into perspective, an increase of only a couple of points on a mean score (from perhaps 86 to 88), can mean the difference between a hospital being in the 50th percentile versus the 75th.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Harvard data analysis revealed that out of the 123 Press Ganey client hospitals in the United States, 45 percent of those in the top quartile for physician engagement were designated Magnets, while only 16 percent in the bottom quartile were Magnet designated facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Excellence in Nursing Care Models Does Not Require Magnet Designation\r\n\r\nEven though the Magnet designation is indicative of a hospital\u2019s commitment to excellence, it does not mean a hospital or healthcare organization needs this status to achieve excellence in nursing care models. Culture of acute nursing care as an outline of Magnet has an emphasis on autonomy, quality, leadership, and relationship \u2013 but these core values should expand beyond the nursing staff and into the climate of care provided throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nThis type of devotion requires a commitment to transformational change in order to drive workforce engagement, safety, clinical excellence, and positive patient experiences.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n \n","html":"<p>As a nurse, there&#8217;s probably one or more times in your career when either yourself personally or another nurse &#8220;saved the day&#8221; on behalf of a physician.

Staffing needs are a result of a variety of circumstances which include:\r\n\r\n- Maternity leave\r\n- Seasonal population fluctuations\r\n- Holiday needs\r\n\r\nNational statistics predict that the need for travel nurses will only increase in the next few years. The[ U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK493175\/) that there will but a shortage of approximately 1.1 million nurses by 2020. Considering this dire need for nurses \u2013 there has to be a solution to fill in the gaps! That is where travel nurses come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Do Travel Nursing Jobs Work?\r\n\r\nHealthcare facilities and hospitals work with travel nursing staffing agencies to hire nurses for their short-term staffing needs. Travel nursing agencies are the ones responsible for creating the contracts which are agreed upon by the nurse and the healthcare facility who is hiring the nurse. Essentially, the travel nursing agency serves as the middleman to make these connections and fill the staffing needs of the hospitals and healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of travel nursing jobs available that can be short-term or long-term. Most travel nursing contracts will last anywhere from eight to 26 weeks \u2013 however \u2013 the industry standard is 13-week contracts for travel nurses. If a hospital or healthcare facility has a continued need for help beyond those 13 weeks, they will offer to extend the initial contract. Due to ongoing nursing shortages, facilities are becoming increasingly flexible when it comes to travel nursing contracts.\r\n\r\nThe travel nurse has the freedom to decide whether they want the stability that comes with a long-term travel nursing contract, or the flexibility of signing onto a short-term travel nursing contract. Once the nurse and the hospital manager have signed the contract, it is a legal document and ending a contract early is rarely permitted. If you want to accept a travel nursing contract but you are not sure which length is best, you should go with a lower time frame, such as 10 or 13 weeks, and you can possibly extend or choose a different contract length on your next assignment.\r\n\r\nFacilities and hospitals are allowed to terminate your contract early if there is not a need for your position. If this happens, you will not be compensated to the end of the contract length \u2013 however \u2013 your nursing staffing agency will work hard to place you on another assignment quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to Become a Travel Nurse?\r\n\r\nIn order to[ become a travel nurse](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/trade-in-your-permanent-address-to-become-a-travel-nurse\/), you must first be a registered nurse. Beyond that, there is no additional training or education required. However, if you do have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) you are more marketable than nurses with just an Associate\u2019s Degree in Nursing (ADN).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, you will need to have completed at least two years in your specialty before accepting your first travel nursing assignment. Your orientation period to a new unit will be very short \u2013 typically two to three shifts maximum. During this orientation period, you will need to learn the unit, get acquainted with your coworkers, learn the patient population, and get a grasp on the computer charting system. You will not be using this time to learn the nursing basics \u2013 which is why it\u2019s important that you have some experience under your belt to start.\r\n\r\nIn order to accept a travel nursing assignment, you must already be licensed in the state where the contract is. Most travel nursing agencies will help the nurse acquire the necessary licenses, but the process could take a few weeks or even months to obtain. If you hold a license in a state that is part of the[ Enhanced Nursing Licensure Compact (eNLC)](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/11945.htm), your license will be good in 29 states that are currently part of the agreement \u2013 and a few more that are set to join soon.

You will find them in larger hospitals, outpatient centers, and smaller community hospitals. You can find travel nursing jobs in metropolitan cities and smaller rural towns as well. If you are unsure where exactly you want to go for work, travel nursing gives you the ability to try out many settings.\r\n\r\nIn order to narrow down the many options for travel nursing jobs, it\u2019s important to determine why you want to be a travel nurse in the first place.

Whether you are currently on assignment or just seeking out the highest paying travel nursing jobs, there are some tricks of the trade you should know about when it comes to finding the right assignments.\r\n\r\nTop nursing assignments which offer the industry\u2019s best travel nurse pay and benefits fill up fast and could have a lot of applicants. How can you stand out from the pack and ensure you have the best possible chance at landing your dream travel nursing job? Keep reading to learn six travel nursing tips to help you land the travel nursing assignment that\u2019s right for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Six Travel Nursing Tips to Secure Your Ideal Nursing Assignment**\r\n\r\n\r\n## **1. Start Searching for Travel Nursing Jobs Early**\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to travel nursing, there is no such thing as being too early. Many professionals are now taking control of their nursing career and searching for their next travel assignment online or with an innovative online job searching application. However, one of the best places to start looking for your next travel nursing assignment is by touching base with a travel nursing recruiter that you can trust. If you have already been working with a travel nursing agency or staffing specialist, keep the lines of communication open, and reach out to them to see what types of assignments they have available.\r\n\r\nTalk to your travel nursing specialist about the jobs you want to keep an eye out for, even if you are already on an assignment. Let them know what your next job of interest is, and the one after that, and so on, so that your travel nursing recruiter can be on the lookout for ideal jobs for you when they come up. You can even book your assignments sometimes up to five months in advance! This means you could potentially have your next assignment already confirmed and set while you\u2019re heading out to your current travel nursing assignment.\r\n\r\nPlanning ahead and booking your travel nursing assignment early helps you to get a better handle on your schedule and to secure time off for a holiday, and allows you to plan for ample time in between assignments for any vacation plans or time needed for certification and licensure.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **2. Clearly State What You\u2019re Looking for in a Travel Nursing Assignment**\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the most important factor you\u2019re looking for in your next travel nursing job? What matters most to you? Are you looking for the highest-paying travel nursing assignments? Are you trying to find work only in a specific location? Or even a certain facility? Whatever it is that matters most to you in your next travel nursing assignment, let your staffing specialist know about this right off the bat.\r\n\r\nA good travel nursing recruiter will be sure to connect you with the right contracts that meet your professional and personal experience levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **3. Keep Your Eye Out for New Opportunities**\r\n\r\nWhile most travel nursing recruiters do a pretty good job of letting you know when and what type of assignments become available, do not rely on them to do it all. Sign up online for job alerts. Search for new travel nursing assignments regularly. Download an innovate nursing job search app that allows you to apply online with just a click of a button for the best travel nursing assignments as they become available.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the digital era, and you owe it to yourself to take advantage of these online tools to help you find the hottest travel nursing assignments as they become available.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **4. Be Proactive with Your Travel Nursing Documents and Onboarding Information**\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, be sure that you do not procrastinate and wait until the last minute to get your nursing paperwork in order. It is strongly advised to have your travel nursing paperwork prepared in advance prior to any job searching activities. In order to stay organized and have all these travel nurse documents in one place, you should consider using an application that allows you to upload and save a portfolio of the necessary paperwork required to start any travel nursing assignment. Points of consideration when it comes to having your logistics in order are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Ensure your nurse licensure information is up to date and have copies available. If your home state in which you hold a nursing license is part of the enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact (eNLC), you will be able to practice in multiple compact states without having to apply for additional licensure. If you do not have a compact license or you want to work in a state that is not part of the[ eNLC](https:\/\/www.ncsbn.org\/11945.htm),\u00a0 be sure that you obtain the licensure early, as some states take a while to process the paperwork.\r\n- Obtain any additional licensing needed for the area in which you want to work (in advance when possible).\r\n- Be sure your health certificates for your physical exam, PPD test, and immunization records\/exemptions are current (the physical exam and PPD test must be within one year of the contract date).\r\n- Have current cards that are good for at least another six months for BLS, ALS, PALS or other additional certifications ready to go.\r\n- Have contact information for two clinical references who were supervisors or managers. Your options include:- a performance evaluation;\r\n- a written letter; or\r\n- contact details.\r\n- Keep copies of any of your skills checklists and other paperwork you have available that may be useful to your staffing specialist or recruiter.\r\n- Have a high-resolution current image with a white background on file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **5. Smash the Travel Nursing Job Interview**\r\n\r\nAfter you and your travel nursing specialist have decided on an assignment that fits your needs and they submit you for an assignment \u2013 or \u2013 you have applied using an app for travel nursing jobs \u2013 if the employer is interested they will set up an interview.\r\n\r\nNormally, the interview will include a phone call that will take place with a hiring manager. This gives you the chance to convey your professionalism and skill set \u2013 which is super important for landing the travel nursing job of your dreams. Preparation is imperative, so be sure you are ready to put your best foot forward and showcase your nursing skills. Often times, you will receive a job offer on the same day that you have your interview!\r\n\r\n\r\n## **6. Accept the Travel Nursing Job Offer that\u2019s Best for You**\r\n\r\nBe ready to just say \u201cyes\u201d when the offer comes through. If you delay giving an immediate answer, you could potentially lose the opportunity if it gets filled by a different nurse.\r\n\r\nThe best registered nurses who work on travel assignments understand the importance of staying flexible. Sometimes you might not land the exact nursing job you thought you wanted, but you might be offered a different 13-week contract that fits all of your absolute requirements on your list. Keep an open mind and consider taking a travel nursing assignment, even if it was not your first choice, and it might work out better than you expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Are You Ready to Search for Your Next Travel Nursing Assignment?**\r\n\r\nWe are ready to help you!

Some people want to know every last detail of the housing situation and others are happy to go along with the flow as long as the pay is good and they have a place to sleep when they get off work.\r\n\r\nExploring your new environment and sight-seeing are great benefits of taking a travel nursing assignment. At the end of the day, you still want to feel relaxed and comfortable in your home environment. As a travel nurse myself, I have heard horror stories from other travel nurses about their housing situations that scared them away from travel nursing altogether.\r\n\r\nIn order to better understand the housing arrangements for travel nurses, I am going to break down the different options you will have available and the pros and cons of taking the company-provided option versus the housing stipend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Travel Nurse Housing Options\r\n\r\nHousing for travel nurses can be done two different ways:\r\n\r\n- **Agency-placed housing**\u00a0\u2014 in this option the agency makes all the housing arrangements on your behalf. You just show up, and everything is ready to go.\r\n- **Stipend pay**\u00a0\u2014 in this option you are given a tax-free stipend and you make your own housing arrangements independent of the agency. These payments are calculated based on the cost-of-living for a given area in which the travel nursing assignment is located.\r\n\r\nPart of my desire to become a travel nurse was because my husband and I wanted a good excuse to live in our RV with our kid for a while, but not permanently. Because my housing was already decided, I always took the stipend. However, I have met many travel nurses who always take the stipend so they can show up and just get to work. Other travel nurses might alternate and take the stipend for one assignment, but choose company-provided housing for the next. Neither option is necessarily better than the other, it really just depends on you as the travel nurse and what works best in your situation.\r\n\r\n### How Does Agency-Placed Housing Work?\r\n\r\nMost travel nurses opt for company-provided housing. Many travel nurse staffing companies have their own internal housing department that is in charge of securing short-term leases or they have long-leases and they alternate the travelers. In addition to housing, the agency will also pay your utilities and rent a furniture package. You might even be able to secure housewares like dishes and linen, but this might come with a charge. It\u2019s not common, but it\u2019s also not unheard of, for a travel nursing agency to also pay for internet and cable.\r\n\r\nThe majority of travel nursing contracts are booked within two weeks (sometimes even two days) of the start date. If you ask, your travel nurse agency may be able to provide you two or three options to choose from for the housing.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Agency-Placed Housing\r\n\r\n- **It\u2019s simple**. If you are easy-going and don\u2019t have too many concerns about the housing or if you are new to travel nursing, you may want to choose this option simply because it\u2019s easier. You don\u2019t have to fool around with security deposits, utilities, etc.\u00a0\r\n- **Housing can be hard to find.**\u00a0It\u2019s not always easy to find housing, especially if you are traveling to a smaller city.\r\n- **You score a deal on housing prices.**\u00a0Travel nurse staffing companies often have negotiations in place so that they can provide you better options for housing than what you could buy with the stipend.\r\n- **No up front money is needed.** You can show up for your assignment and not worry about having extra money for things like a lease, deposit, etc.\r\n- **Cancellations won\u2019t set you back**. If your assignment is canceled early for any reason, if you chose the agency-provided housing you will not have to pay for a broken lease agreement, etc.\r\n- **VIP Treatment. **Landlords and property managers can be a nightmare to work with sometimes. However, if they know that they are trying to please a company with the potential for long-term commitment and not a single individual there for just a short time \u2013 they are likely to be more attentive and helpful.\u00a0\r\n\r\n### How Does Travel Nurse Stipend Pay Work?\r\n\r\nIf you decide to forgo the agency-placed housing and take the stipend, you are in charge of finding, paying for, and booking all of the housing arrangements you will need and whatever additional expenses that may require. The amount of this payout will vary based on location, but you will be given a monthly quote, and that amount will be divided into your weekly paychecks.\r\n\r\nWith the emergence of sites like Airbnb, it\u2019s becoming easier for travel nurses to find vacation rentals that come equipped with everything you need even down to the dishes. You can find your own house or apartment to rent. Or you can do what I did, and live in an RV and pay for campgrounds with amenities on site.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Travel Nurse Stipend Pay\r\n\r\n- **You decide where you want to live.**\u00a0Finding your own housing opens up new opportunities to live in exotic places. Company-provided housing is typically standard apartments or condos without a lot of flares.\r\n- **You can choose how to live.** Many times the agency-placed housing will not have its own washer and dryer unit. There may be other things too that are not up to your preferred living standard. Taking the stipend allows you to make arrangements for housing that has everything you want and need to make it a comfortable stay.\r\n- **You might be able to make money off your housing stipend.**\u00a0This is a true variable and depends greatly on the location, but there is the possibility of securing cheap housing and pocketing the extra income. If you\u2019re able to travel with another nurse \u2013 you can save even more by sharing a cheap accommodation and splitting the cost.\r\n- **You can settle in on your own schedule.**\u00a0The standard for agency-placed housing is to allow you to come to the place only two days in advance. While that can be plenty, if you want to spend time settling in and getting to know the area, if you work out your own housing arrangements, you can allocate for extra time if you want it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Are You Searching For a Travel Nursing Job?\r\n\r\nIf so, we want to hear from you.

Statistics from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/ted\/2017\/union-membership-rate-10-point-7-percent-in-2016.htm), show only 10.7 percent of American workers belonged to a union in 2016 and only 18 percent of registered nurses (RNs) belonged to a union.

If you have not already faced this decision as a travel nurse, one day you might have to decide whether or not you should join a nurses union.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is a Nurses Union?\r\n\r\nIn order to explain what a nurses union is, it\u2019s best to start with what a union is in general. A union is an organization composed of either one or several types of workers who have the objective to represent the collective interests of their peers who are either inside of a workplace or throughout a nation or state. Collective bargaining is the tool most often used by unions to help improve and secure better working conditions \u2013 which can include better benefits and higher wages.\r\n\r\nA union is made up of a group of people who are committed to protecting the interests of a large group of workers. As part of their duties, a union collects information from the people they represent and take this valuable input and use it when they craft concise proposals, which they will present to the appropriate authorities. When collective bargaining and all else fails, the union has the power to organize a strike. However, strikes must be done only when needed and very meticulously, because there is a chance that an employer could simply hire a whole new set of workers to replace the ones on strike.\r\n\r\nA nurses union does all these things and more and the group is composed of a body of nurses \u2013 who represent nurses. So what are the pros and cons of joining a nursing union? Keep reading to find out.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Pros of Joining a Nurses Union\r\n\r\n- **Higher Wages**: one of the most common reasons why nurses join a union is for better pay. Nurses unions will fight for better salaries. This scenario plays out often in positions where severe understaffing is present or when nurses are forced to work in sub-optimal conditions. There is a claim made by pro nurses union advocates that a unionized nurse could earn $200 to $400 more per week than a non-unionized nurse.\r\n- **Improved Nurse Working Conditions:** nurses unions fight for improved working conditions, which could involve a variety of factors, such as: safe nurse-to-patient ratios, better safety protocols, access to appropriate hygiene and safety equipment, and elimination of mandatory overtime. All of these factors are important to address because many studies show that poor nurse workplace conditions are driving the nursing shortage as they become pained, tired, and stressed.\r\n- **Legal Representation:** if a nurse is in breach of a protocol that requires disciplinary action, there will be a union representative sent to ensure the nurse is treated fairly. Furthermore, if a nurse is on the receiving end of mistreatment that can be verbal or physical in nature, and they have grievances in the workplace, the union is there to ensure such complaints reach the right authorities.\r\n- **Job Security**: non-union nurses subject to \u201cat will employment\u201d can be fired or let go at any time, for any reason \u2013 or could have their hours cut at the discretion of management. Unionized contracts typically have clauses written in to forbid the dismissal of a nurse for arbitrary reasons and prohibit hour cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cons of Joining a Nurses Union\r\n\r\n- **Union Dues**: in most cases, a nurse must pay a percentage of their earnings as \u201cunion dues\u201d for the representation body. This is largely the reason why the majority of employees do not want to be unionized.\r\n- **Unpaid Strikes**: if a union decides to initiate a nursing strike, that requires the nurse to skip work without any pay. On rare occasions, a nurses union may have a strike fund in case this happens, but that is not the typical scenario.\r\n- **Difficulty Firing Underperforming Employees**: there is a real downside of the representation of a nurses union in this respect. If there is a bad egg or a very troublesome nurse, it may be very difficult to fire them due to their contracts.\r\n- **Job Risks**: there are risks of joining a union. There are some employers who will do everything in their power to fire a worker who is trying to organize or join a union. This is not a legal practice, but it is commonplace. It would be difficult to prove this was the employer\u2019s intent, even when it\u2019s quite obvious. Furthermore, if the union calls for a strike, the nurse could be permanently replaced by a nurse willing to cross the picket line.\r\n- **Seniority-based Promotions**: not always is the case, but quite often, unionized workers receive promotions based on seniority and not on job performance. This means that a hard-working nurse who has been striving for a promotion could be passed up by an underperforming employee.\r\n\r\nYou may face a time in your nursing career where you will be forced to decide whether you put your loyalty to your employer or to your fellow peers. As the nursing shortage continues and more nurses strike poor working conditions, these scenarios will only increase. Use this information to help you decide whether or not to join a union when that time comes.\r\n\r\nAre you ready to search for a travel nursing assignment?

While I was drowning in the assignments and sorting through the endless notes and tireless to-do schedules, the idea of getting paid to travel while taking care of people motivated me to never give up and always do my best.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Nursing was My Destiny\r\n\r\nI had a background in caregiving. My grandmother with Alzheimer\u2019s lived with us for many years and I was a nurse\u2019s assistant for a couple of years before I went to nursing school. One of the ideas that always felt daunting to me was that in order to travel you had to have two years experience under your belt first. Boy, that sounded like a long time to reach my dreams back then. Fast-forward to post-nursing school graduation, I had a comfortable staff position at a local community hospital. In fact, the job and the pay were so comfortable that I ended up putting off my plans to [become a travel nurse](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/trade-in-your-permanent-address-to-become-a-travel-nurse\/) for a little longer. After four years in this position, I let it go to pursue my dream of being a travel nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting My Feet Wet\r\n\r\nWhen I ventured out into the world to look for [travel nursing jobs](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/travel-nursing-jobs\/), the first thing I came across was [local agency per diem nursing jobs](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/per-diem-nursing-jobs\/). A friend of mine referred me to the company and to my surprise, the pay rate was $10 an hour more than I was getting at my staff job. Agency work was a dream come true for me. Through the local nurse staffing company, I was able to land several shifts in different hospitals working per diem, and I was also able to get 13-week contracts at local hospitals.\r\n\r\nI was earning pay similar to a travel nurse, but I still had not traveled. After about a year and a half of solid agency work, I began looking for [travel nursing assignments](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/jobs\/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Searching for My First Travel Nursing Assignment\r\n\r\n### Location is Everything\r\n\r\nTravel nursing was going to be an adventure that included the entire family \u2013 my husband, three-year-old son, mini dachshund, and myself. One of the reasons we wanted to pursue travel nursing as a family was so we could spend some time living in our class-A RV. We decided to ditch the winter in Ohio and travel to Florida for a seasonal nursing contract from December through February. This worked well for my family because my husband ran a tree service that was seasonal and the winter was the slow months anyway.\r\n\r\nFlorida was a given for us for many reasons:\r\n\r\n- I have an aunt that works at Disney World and we went once a year for free Disney anyway.\r\n- Florida has a lot of travel nursing assignments available every winter to accommodate the influx in populations because of all the snow-birds. This gave me plenty of options to choose from.\r\n- Because it\u2019s a vacationer\u2019s paradise, there are several nice RV parks in most parts of Florida that would have all the amenities we would require.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to narrowing down to which city I wanted to work in, there were a lot of things I considered:\r\n\r\n- Orlando, where my aunt lived, is a big city and I grew up in a small town. I wanted to work in a smaller town because that felt safe for me.\r\n- I wanted to work close to the beach (preferably on the Gulf side).\r\n- At this point in my career, the majority of my nursing experience was only in local community hospitals. I was nervous about taking a contract in a large metropolitan hospital. So I searched for contracts in smaller hospitals.\r\n\r\n### Getting Things in Order\r\n\r\nI had been searching online for various travel nursing assignments for months. When I was about three months away from my preferred start day, I started calling around and talking with the agencies. One thing I realized right away is that I need to get started on the Florida licensure ASAP because it could take four to six weeks to process. Once I had that in order, I also went through all of my credentialing and certificates (ALS, BLS, PALS) to make sure that was all up-to-date and that I had current vaccination records.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Choosing a Travel Nursing Agency\r\n\r\nMany hours were spent comparing the websites of different travel nursing companies before I made my decision. Ultimately, the one who got my attention the most was an agency that had lots of jobs listed, along with approximate pay rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Landing My First Travel Nursing Job\r\n\r\nI found an assignment on the Gulf Coast at a small community hospital in a small town, Englewood, Florida. It felt meant to be. I spoke with my recruiter and found out that the hospital still had many positions available. My specialty was in Med-Surg, and there were open jobs on that particular unit. She called the hospital and I was on the phone for an interview, literally the next day. I hit it out of the park and was offered the job. I accepted the position about one month before the start date.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Wrapping Up Final Logistics Before My First Day\r\n\r\nEverything after that happened pretty quickly. My recruiter sent me a mess of forms to fill out and complete, some by me, and others by appropriate authorities. I had to get an updated physical, a drug test, a couple more vaccines to add to the list, in addition to filling out the regular types of paperwork that go with any job, IRS forms, direct deposit forms, etc.\r\n\r\nAll of the logistics were taken care of a couple of weeks in advance of the position. This gave me plenty of time to pack, prep, and take care of the planning I needed to do at home to take off for the winter. When my first day rolled around, I was there on time and ready to hit the floor running\u2026 and I did.\r\n\r\n \n","html":"\n<p>Ever since I made the decision to go to nursing school, it was my dream to become a travel nurse. While I was drowning in the assignments and sorting through the endless notes and tireless to-do schedules, the idea of getting paid to travel while taking care of people motivated me to never give up and always do my best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nursing was My Destiny<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a background in caregiving. My grandmother with Alzheimer&#8217;s lived with us for many years and I was a nurse&#8217;s assistant for a couple of years before I went to nursing school. One of the ideas that always felt daunting to me was that in order to travel you had to have two years experience under your belt first. Boy, that sounded like a long time to reach my dreams back then. Fast-forward to post-nursing school graduation, I had a comfortable staff position at a local community hospital. In fact, the job and the pay were so comfortable that I ended up putting off my plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/trade-in-your-permanent-address-to-become-a-travel-nurse\/\">become a travel nurse<\/a> for a little longer. After four years in this position, I let it go to pursue my dream of being a travel nurse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting My Feet Wet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I ventured out into the world to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/travel-nursing-jobs\/\">travel nursing jobs<\/a>, the first thing I came across was <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/per-diem-nursing-jobs\/\">local agency per diem nursing jobs<\/a>. A friend of mine referred me to the company and to my surprise, the pay rate was $10 an hour more than I was getting at my staff job. Agency work was a dream come true for me. Through the local nurse staffing company, I was able to land several shifts in different hospitals working per diem, and I was also able to get 13-week contracts at local hospitals. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was earning pay similar to a travel nurse, but I still had not traveled. After about a year and a half of solid agency work, I began looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/jobs\/\">travel nursing assignments<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Searching for My First Travel Nursing Assignment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Location is Everything<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel nursing was going to be an adventure that included the entire family &#8211; my husband, three-year-old son, mini dachshund, and myself.

What is the housing like? How much is the housing stipend going to be? Where will the housing be located in relation to the hospital or healthcare facility I work at?\r\n\r\nMany questions about housing arise when looking at [travel nursing jobs](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/travel-nursing-jobs\/). There are also a lot of things you might want to know about travel nurse housing in general. I\u2019ve taken the initiative to compile all of the possible questions and answers you might have about travel nursing housing, and put it all right here, for your convenience. Without further ado, let\u2019s get to it!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q: Is the agency-provided housing 100% covered?\r\n\r\nA. Generally speaking, yes. If you accept the agency housing option, then everything you need on very basic terms is covered. However, if you choose to get upgrades (nicer apartment, two bedrooms, washer and dryer unit, upgraded packages for furnishings, etc.) \u2013 then you will be expected to pay the extra cost for those upgrades. Also, if you choose to take the travel housing stipend and you find something to rent for under the budget provided, then the answer to this question is also yes. However, if you take the stipend but do not find anything under this budget, then you are also spending more out of pocket for your travel nurse housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. Will agency-sponsored housing come fully-furnished?\r\n\r\nA. Furnished? Yes. Fully-furnished? Depends on what you consider \u201cfully\u201d. Generally speaking, agency-provided housing will have the following:\r\n\r\n- **Bedroom:**\u00a0Queen-size bed, one dresser, night stand, a lamp\r\n- **Dining room:**\u00a0Small kitchen table with four chairs\r\n- **Living room:**\u00a0Sofa, chair, coffee table, end table, a lamp, a TV stand\r\n\r\nA. Anything else that you want to be there when you arrive, such as linens, dishes, bedding, and a vacuum cleaner would be considered extra and therefore cost more. You also might not have a washer and dryer unit and a microwave available \u2013 so those might also be additional expenses if you want to have them there. Agencies can often help you make arrangements to have those extras there for a cost, or you can bring them with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. How do I set up internet and\/or cable?\r\n\r\nA. Once you have a housing situation established and a confirmed address (whether this has been done by the travel nursing agency or you) call the landlord or property manager and find out what providers are local to the area. Compare prices of the local providers and make sure they have plans available that are not long-term. Also, be sure you check out all the information about the housing arrangement with your agency for the provided housing, because there is often wifi and\/or cable included already. If you are staying in an RV, be sure that you look for camping grounds that have these services available to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. Does the agency pay for utilities, such as water, electric, gas, cable, etc.?\r\n\r\nA. In most situations, the travel nursing agency will pay for most of the utilities (water, gas, electric) up to certain limits. Cable and internet, however, are considered extras in most cases and will require and out-of-pocket expense. It\u2019s not unheard of, but it\u2019s not common either for an agency to cover internet and cable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. If I choose agency-provided housing, do I get any say in where I stay?\r\n\r\nA. The general practice in the travel nursing industry is to give a nurse two to three options for housing to choose from. If your travel nursing staffing agency doesn\u2019t give you more than one option, if you ask them, they might be able to. Typically, even if you request a specific one, it\u2019s not going to guarantee that you get it. If you have specific housing requirements, be sure you voice your concerns to your recruiter and stress their importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. How do I find my own housing if I take the stipend?\r\n\r\nYour options are endless. With new websites like Airbnb showing listings for short-term vacation rentals, it has become relatively easy to find housing to rent short-term that often comes fully furnished.\r\n\r\nBe sure that you consider your safety, and if you find a housing option that sounds too cheap to be true, carefully research the area to make sure it\u2019s not in a bad part of town where your safety could be compromised.\r\n\r\nThe following are some great resources you can consider while searching for your own housing arrangements:\r\n\r\n- Househunting websites such as\u00a0[forrent.com](https:\/\/www.forrent.com\/)\u00a0and\u00a0[apartments.com](https:\/\/www.apartments.com\/).\r\n- Vacation rental websites such as [VRBO.com](https:\/\/www.vrbo.com\/)\u00a0and\u00a0[homeaway.com](https:\/\/www.homeaway.com\/).\r\n- Temporary housing websites such as\u00a0[sublet.com](https:\/\/www.sublet.com\/)\u00a0and\u00a0[airbnb.com](https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/).\r\n- Non-traditional housing searches like [couchsurfing.org](https:\/\/www.couchsurfing.com\/)\u00a0or houseboat rentals (Google by city for best results).\r\n- Hotels that offer extended stays\u00a0such as [Candlewood](https:\/\/www.ihg.com\/candlewood\/hotels\/us\/en\/reservation),\u00a0[Extended Stay America](https:\/\/www.extendedstayamerica.com\/),\u00a0[Residence Inn](https:\/\/www.residenceinn.marriott.com\/), etc.\r\n- Hire a local realtor to help you find a place.\r\n- Stay with a friend or family member when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. What determines the amount of a housing stipend?\r\n\r\nYour travel nurse housing stipend will be determined by the contract, the city, and how your [travel nursing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/) breaks down pay packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. Do I have to have a roommate?\r\n\r\nA. Generally speaking, no. However, there are cases, such as during [nursing strike jobs](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/nursing-strike-advice-for-travel-nurses-7-considerations-for-crossing-the-picket-line\/), in which you might have to room with a fellow nurse or receive less pay for a private room. This information will be disclosed to you upfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. Can I bring a pet?\r\n\r\nA. Yes! This is something that can be arranged. Be sure you let your recruiter know upfront about the pet so they can find pet-friendly housing, and be prepared for a small pet deposit.\r\n\r\nRead more:\u00a0[10 Travel Nursing Tips for Bringing Pets with You to an Assignment](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/10-travel-nursing-tips-for-bringing-pets-with-you-to-an-assignment\/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Q. What if I arrive at my assignment and hate my housing?\r\n\r\nA. While agencies will do their best to give you plenty of details about the housing upfront and find nice places for you to stay, everybody has different tastes and this scenario can and does happen. If you find yourself in this situation, the first thing you need to do is contact your recruiter immediately. In most cases, they will fix the situation if it is truly unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## One more thing before you go\u2026\r\n\r\nBe sure that you know in advance what your housing is going to be like before you arrive at your travel nursing assignment. If you do not like any of the housing options the agency has given you, you could either find your own housing or decline the contract. Housing is usually the most stressful part of any travel nursing assignment. Be upfront with your recruiter about what you need in terms of housing from the very beginning of the conversation.\r\n\r\nDuring the planning stages, do your due diligence. Read the reviews of a property, research the new city you\u2019re moving to, ask questions, etc. If you\u2019ve been thorough in your research, this should avoid any unforeseen surprises down the road.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a travel nursing assignment, we want to hear from you!

Hospitals have increased needs in these areas because it costs more and takes longer to train new graduates than it does to hire a travel nurse. Therefore, if you are a nurse who works in any of the following specialties, you will have more options when it comes to travel nursing contracts and pay rates:\r\n\r\n1. Labor & Delivery  \r\n2. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  \r\n3. Emergency Room  \r\n4. Operating Room (including training in Cardiovascular and Orthopedics)  \r\n5. Intensive Care Unit\r\n\r\nHowever, considering there is a nursing shortage nationwide, even if you are not skilled in any of these particular areas, you should still not have any problems finding a travel nursing contract that works for you.

That has prompted a nationwide re-evaluation in the way\u00a0doctors, nurses, first responders, hospitals and law enforcement officials prepare for and respond to such events.\r\n\r\nOne hospital where meticulous disaster planning was put into practice is the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC),\u00a0the only level-one trauma center in the state, where 104 patients arrived on Oct. 1, 2017 after\u00a0[a lone gunman opened fire at an outdoor country music festiva](https:\/\/www.salon.com\/2017\/10\/02\/las-vegas-concert-shooting-leaves-at-least-50-people-dead\/)l, killing 58 people and injuring more than 800 others.\r\n\r\nBut even two decades as a trauma surgeon couldn\u2019t steel\u00a0Dr. John Fildes\u00a0for the terror he encountered that night \u2014 in both the sheer number of patients and the extent of their injuries.\r\n\r\nFildes began his shift at UMC just minutes after gunfire stopped at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Within minutes, tens of concert-goers clinging for their\u00a0life had streamed into the hospital. Soon after that, bodies punctured by\u00a0high-velocity gunshots arrived in droves \u2014 via ambulances,\u00a0private cars, taxis, trucks, buses, Lyfts and Ubers. Some victims even arrived on foot.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Salon, Fildes\u00a0explained that while the hospital had conducted drills in the past to prepare for mass casualty incidents like nightclub shootings, chemical spills and plane crashes,\u00a0it hadn\u2019t activated them \u201cto the same extent\u201d before that October night.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere have been a number of things over a number of years that we\u2019ve had to respond to where we saw a few dozen patients all at once but this was the biggest one,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cNot only is it the biggest one we\u2019ve ever done, but this is actually the biggest one in U.S. history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that volume of patients,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut because our plan was flexible it allowed us to expand into other areas of our hospital and continue accepting wounded patients.\u201d\r\n\r\nFildes added that he had \u201cno way of anticipating what the following day or two were going to look like,\u201d and said the hospital had prepared for an attack like the one carried out in Paris on November 13, 2015, when coordinated terrorist cells killed 130 people and wounded over 400 in bombings and shootings that hit six locations in and around the city and occured only minutes apart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was convinced based on the ferocity of this attack that there would be other cells opening up in the city over the night,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the city could have absorbed one to two hundred patients, three or four times.\u201d\r\n\r\nEmergency physicians, surgeons, medicine residents\u00a0and fellows operated throughout the night, the next day and beyond.\u00a0Fildes and the surgery department he chairs saved every one of the 104 patients who arrived at the hospital with survivable injuries.\r\n\r\nStill, he pointed out the tragedies that unfold in hospitals affect not just patients and their families, but also the nurses and doctors who care for them. The medical center began mandatory counseling for staffers the next day.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t help but be affected by it,\u201d he said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThey dedicate their lives to a science of healing and service, and this was such a sad and unnecessary event.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do the most for the most and you protect yourself while showing compassion and resilience to your patients and your colleagues,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you want a quote, that\u2019s my quote right there.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot all hospitals are equally prepared, however,\u00a0according to the results of a\u00a0[poll](https:\/\/newsroom.acep.org\/2018-05-22-Most-Emergency-Physicians-Report-Hospitals-Lack-Critical-Medicines-Not-Fully-Prepared-for-Disasters-Mass-Casualty-Incidents)\u00a0conducted last year by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). Roughly 93% of physicians said they don\u2019t believe their emergency departments are \u201cfully prepared\u201d to take in a large influx of patients in the event of a natural disaster, human-made catastrophe, or other mass casualty incident.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of last week\u2019s shootings in El Paso, Dayton and Gilroy, the American Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and other physician and health organizations have again stressed that\u00a0[gun violence is a public health care crisis](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmerMedicalAssn\/status\/1158068584956006402\/photo\/1).\r\n\r\n\u201cThe frequency and scale of these mass shootings demands action,\u201d AMA president Patrice Harris said in a statement.\r\n\r\nAs many health care providers continue to wait for lawmakers to take meaningful action to curb gun violence, hospitals across the country have developed emergency plans and conducted drills to ensure they have the protocols in place to respond to the unthinkable.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year in Ohio, medical students and residents participated in an active shooter drill that included a police officer acting as a live gunman\u00a0firing blank rounds from a handgun in a classroom setting. The drill required some students to become the simulated victims or caregivers at the same time.\r\n\r\nDr. Nicholas Kman, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, told Salon that while the exercise was \u201cvery stress-producing,\u201d it provided students an opportunity to practice responding to injuries as they happened.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do these drills enough, when the real thing happens it actually feels a bit like a drill,\u201d he said, noting that the real thing could \u201chappen anywhere.\u201d Having students serve as victims also provided students with a better view of the \u201cvictim\u2019s side of the response \u2014 how we show compassion, how we treat each victim like a person, how quick we are with taking care of the bleeding,\u201d Kman said.\r\n\r\nDr. Kevin Ching, pediatric emergency medicine physician with NewYork-Presbyterian\/Weill Cornell Medical Center echoed those sentiments but stressed that nationwide preparedness for disasters involving children, in particular, remain inadequate.\r\n\r\nTo develop hands-on experience responding to pediatric emergencies, Ching co-founded\u00a0[BASE Camp](https:\/\/pembasecamp.org\/overview\/), a pediatric emergency medicine \u201cboot camp.\u201d Hosted annually, the camp allows pediatric nurses, fellows and physicians to practice treating a large influx of critically ill children by using real-life mannequins that bleed, cry, move their faces, and talk.\r\n\r\nChing said he developed the program because \u201cemergency departments are now being challenged to prepare for acts of large-scale violence, like school shootings,\u201d which said was once a \u201crarely encountered situation in pediatrics.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two-day training program requires participants to respond to more than 20 critically wounded trauma \u201cpatients\u201d amid a packed hospital filled with children on stretchers with gunshot wounds, screaming infants, and\u00a0parents scrambling to find their kids.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just mass chaos in the room, [but] it\u2019s a means for people to practice something that hopefully never happens,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you really prepare for something like this unless you\u2019ve actually had the chance to experience it? You want to be prepared as best as you can.\u201d\r\n\r\nRebecca Hotz, security director at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) in New Jersey, said that while active shooter drills can be frightening, \u201cthe fact that we don\u2019t shy away from them and that we are open about education and preparedness\u201d has instilled confidence in the hospital\u2019s staff that they are ready to respond to such an attack.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing an active part of an emergency preparedness plan just makes you aware of the new reality that we live in,\u201d Dr. Rajan Gupta, director of trauma at RWJUHm told Salon. \u201cThis is a new reality. It\u2019s occurring all too frequently and it makes all of us realize how important it is we are well prepared.\u201d\r\n\r\nRoughly 1,500 miles northwest in North Dakota, Jamestown Regional Medical Center (JRMC) has also educated its staff on how to respond to an active shooter should a real event occur.\r\n\r\nTrisha Jungels, chief nursing officer at JRMC, told Salon the hospital conducted its first active shooter drill in April 2018. Though the facility is located in a rural area with a population a little over 15,000, Jungels told Salon the hospital\u2019s administrators were \u201cpassionate about not ignoring reality and believing that it couldn\u2019t happen in our organization and in our small community.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we first announced that we were going to be completing an active shooter drill, the staff was very anxious about it. They believed that practicing the drill puts our current patients and population at harm and that it would be very scary,\u201d she explained, noting that some staffers expressed concern that the drill could create trigger patients who might have experienced or witnessed a shooting.\r\n\r\nJungels explained the staff prepared for the drill for at least six months prior, noting that \u201cextensive planning\u201d is required before putting one in place.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen that those events happen where you have large populations of people that need medical care, you literally pull resources from every nook and corner of your facility \u2014 and that\u2019s everybody from home health nurses that are out on the field to your teams that work in your operating rooms,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou just redirect staff and community resources to care for those people \u2014 and that care can happen in hallways, in operating rooms, in surgery center rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n \n","html":"\n<p>As mass shootings have become normalized, many Americans have learned to fear public spaces like&nbsp;concert venues, movie theaters, shopping malls, places of worship, and even schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, recent rampages in California, Texas and Ohio have rattled the nation and provoked renewed calls for tougher gun laws.&nbsp;They have also prompted a growing list of countries and organizations to issue travel advisories for the United States, warning of high levels of gun violence that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amnestyusa.org\/press-releases\/global-human-rights-movement-issues-travel-warning-for-the-u-s-due-to-rampant-gun-violence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amnesty International deemed a \u201chuman rights crisis.\u201d<\/a><ins><\/ins><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly half of Americans believe it is likely&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-shooting-poll\/most-americans-expect-next-mass-shooting-to-happen-in-next-three-months-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1UZ1OZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">there will be another major mass shooting in the next three months<\/a>, even though such attacks comprise a small fraction (<a href=\"https:\/\/lawcenter.giffords.org\/facts\/gun-violence-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">between 1% annually<\/a>) of gun-related deaths.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey have nothing to fear,\u201d President Donald Trump said Friday when asked if he had any advice for students who fear gun violence as they return to class for the 2019-2020 school year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, mass shootings linger in the public consciousness, largely because of their scope and their random nature.

Some victims even arrived on foot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview with Salon, Fildes&nbsp;explained that while the hospital had conducted drills in the past to prepare for mass casualty incidents like nightclub shootings, chemical spills and plane crashes,&nbsp;it hadn\u2019t activated them \u201cto the same extent\u201d before that October night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere have been a number of things over a number of years that we\u2019ve had to respond to where we saw a few dozen patients all at once but this was the biggest one,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cNot only is it the biggest one we\u2019ve ever done, but this is actually the biggest one in U.S. history.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that volume of patients,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut because our plan was flexible it allowed us to expand into other areas of our hospital and continue accepting wounded patients.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fildes added that he had \u201cno way of anticipating what the following day or two were going to look like,\u201d and said the hospital had prepared for an attack like the one carried out in Paris on November 13, 2015, when coordinated terrorist cells killed 130 people and wounded over 400 in bombings and shootings that hit six locations in and around the city and occured only minutes apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was convinced based on the ferocity of this attack that there would be other cells opening up in the city over the night,\u201d Fildes said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the city could have absorbed one to two hundred patients, three or four times.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emergency physicians, surgeons, medicine residents&nbsp;and fellows operated throughout the night, the next day and beyond.&nbsp;Fildes and the surgery department he chairs saved every one of the 104 patients who arrived at the hospital with survivable injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, he pointed out the tragedies that unfold in hospitals affect not just patients and their families, but also the nurses and doctors who care for them. The medical center began mandatory counseling for staffers the next day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t help but be affected by it,\u201d he said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThey dedicate their lives to a science of healing and service, and this was such a sad and unnecessary event.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou do the most for the most and you protect yourself while showing compassion and resilience to your patients and your colleagues,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you want a quote, that\u2019s my quote right there.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all hospitals are equally prepared, however,&nbsp;according to the results of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.acep.org\/2018-05-22-Most-Emergency-Physicians-Report-Hospitals-Lack-Critical-Medicines-Not-Fully-Prepared-for-Disasters-Mass-Casualty-Incidents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">poll<\/a>&nbsp;conducted last year by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). Roughly 93% of physicians said they don\u2019t believe their emergency departments are \u201cfully prepared\u201d to take in a large influx of patients in the event of a natural disaster, human-made catastrophe, or other mass casualty incident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of last week\u2019s shootings in El Paso, Dayton and Gilroy, the American Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and other physician and health organizations have again stressed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmerMedicalAssn\/status\/1158068584956006402\/photo\/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gun violence is a public health care crisis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe frequency and scale of these mass shootings demands action,\u201d AMA president Patrice Harris said in a statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many health care providers continue to wait for lawmakers to take meaningful action to curb gun violence, hospitals across the country have developed emergency plans and conducted drills to ensure they have the protocols in place to respond to the unthinkable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year in Ohio, medical students and residents participated in an active shooter drill that included a police officer acting as a live gunman&nbsp;firing blank rounds from a handgun in a classroom setting. The drill required some students to become the simulated victims or caregivers at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Nicholas Kman, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, told Salon that while the exercise was \u201cvery stress-producing,\u201d it provided students an opportunity to practice responding to injuries as they happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you do these drills enough, when the real thing happens it actually feels a bit like a drill,\u201d he said, noting that the real thing could \u201chappen anywhere.\u201d Having students serve as victims also provided students with a better view of the \u201cvictim\u2019s side of the response \u2014 how we show compassion, how we treat each victim like a person, how quick we are with taking care of the bleeding,\u201d Kman said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Kevin Ching, pediatric emergency medicine physician with NewYork-Presbyterian\/Weill Cornell Medical Center echoed those sentiments but stressed that nationwide preparedness for disasters involving children, in particular, remain inadequate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To develop hands-on experience responding to pediatric emergencies, Ching co-founded&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/pembasecamp.org\/overview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BASE Camp<\/a>, a pediatric emergency medicine \u201cboot camp.\u201d Hosted annually, the camp allows pediatric nurses, fellows and physicians to practice treating a large influx of critically ill children by using real-life mannequins that bleed, cry, move their faces, and talk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ching said he developed the program because \u201cemergency departments are now being challenged to prepare for acts of large-scale violence, like school shootings,\u201d which said was once a \u201crarely encountered situation in pediatrics.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two-day training program requires participants to respond to more than 20 critically wounded trauma \u201cpatients\u201d amid a packed hospital filled with children on stretchers with gunshot wounds, screaming infants, and&nbsp;parents scrambling to find their kids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just mass chaos in the room, [but] it\u2019s a means for people to practice something that hopefully never happens,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you really prepare for something like this unless you\u2019ve actually had the chance to experience it? You want to be prepared as best as you can.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebecca Hotz, security director at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) in New Jersey, said that while active shooter drills can be frightening, \u201cthe fact that we don\u2019t shy away from them and that we are open about education and preparedness\u201d has instilled confidence in the hospital\u2019s staff that they are ready to respond to such an attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBeing an active part of an emergency preparedness plan just makes you aware of the new reality that we live in,\u201d Dr. Rajan Gupta, director of trauma at RWJUHm told Salon. \u201cThis is a new reality. It\u2019s occurring all too frequently and it makes all of us realize how important it is we are well prepared.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roughly 1,500 miles northwest in North Dakota, Jamestown Regional Medical Center (JRMC) has also educated its staff on how to respond to an active shooter should a real event occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trisha Jungels, chief nursing officer at JRMC, told Salon the hospital conducted its first active shooter drill in April 2018. Though the facility is located in a rural area with a population a little over 15,000, Jungels told Salon the hospital\u2019s administrators were \u201cpassionate about not ignoring reality and believing that it couldn\u2019t happen in our organization and in our small community.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we first announced that we were going to be completing an active shooter drill, the staff was very anxious about it. They believed that practicing the drill puts our current patients and population at harm and that it would be very scary,\u201d she explained, noting that some staffers expressed concern that the drill could create trigger patients who might have experienced or witnessed a shooting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jungels explained the staff prepared for the drill for at least six months prior, noting that \u201cextensive planning\u201d is required before putting one in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen that those events happen where you have large populations of people that need medical care, you literally pull resources from every nook and corner of your facility \u2014 and that\u2019s everybody from home health nurses that are out on the field to your teams that work in your operating rooms,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou just redirect staff and community resources to care for those people \u2014 and that care can happen in hallways, in operating rooms, in surgery center rooms.\u201d<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":8,"created_at":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 09:41:28 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 09:41:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":25759,"title":"Weighing the Pros and Cons of Travel Nursing","slug":"weighing-the-pros-and-cons-of-travel-nursing","markdown":"\nTravel nursing is not for everybody. While there are a lot of enticing travel nursing benefits, it takes a special kind of person to adapt to so many fast-paced changes in new environments. If you\u2019re considering travel nursing, it\u2019s important that you carefully evaluate the pros and cons to help you decide if it\u2019s right for you.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together this balanced list of the pros and cons of travel nursing so that you can prepare yourself and know what the job requires and if the environment is a good fit for you. Let\u2019s get to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the Pros of Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\n### 1. **High Travel Nurse Salary**\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest [benefits of travel nursing](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com\/benefits\/) that often gets a nurse\u2019s attention is the salary. Travel nurses earn a considerable amount more than their colleagues who work in permanent staff positions. I jumped my pay by an extra $15 per hour when I began working as a travel nurse.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the figures on [Indeed](https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/salaries), it shows that travel nurses make approximately 20 percent more than all registered nurses (RNs).\r\n\r\n### 2. Valuable Experience to Advance Your Nursing Career\r\n\r\nWorking as a travel nurse is a challenging role which will give you plenty of opportunities to grow as a professional. Every assignment you take. Every hospital you work at. All of these new environments and skills you learn will give you valuable experience that is arguably advanced to that gained by staff nurses.\r\n\r\nBy seeing how the dynamics of different hospitals, staff, and environments in healthcare run, you are learning a broader understanding of the nursing profession and the various roles nurses play.\r\n\r\n### 3. Ability to See the Country\r\n\r\nIf you have a knack for travel and adventure, travel nursing is definitely a career path you should consider. Not only do you get to explore new places around the country, but you also get to earn a considerable amount of money to do so.\r\n\r\n### 4. Opportunities to Learn New Specialties as a Nurse\r\n\r\nNot every hospital is a good place to learn other specialties, as many of them require you to have ample experience in a specialty to work there as a travel nurse. However, being in different hospitals and environments exposes you to more opportunities to try new specialties. Gaining experience in different areas of nursing strengthens your career and allows you to find the nursing role that you enjoy the most.\r\n\r\n### 5. Dodge Workplace Drama and Politics\r\n\r\nEvery workplace has its own issues when it comes to management issues and dealing with coworkers. However, in the nursing environment, the long hours worked coupled with high-stress situations and constant interactions with people can create a very volatile environment. If you are a staff nurse and found yourself in this situation, it could be a bad scenario.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you encounter a hostile work environment or rivalry between staff members, as a travel nurse, you just need to remind yourself \u201cnot my circus, not my monkeys.\u201d No matter what the situation is, you are only going to be there temporarily, so enjoy that liberty and avoid workplace conflicts. Besides, you are likely going to be so busy working that you won\u2019t have time to even think about getting into the drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What are the Cons of Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\n### 1. Time Away from Friends and Family\r\n\r\nSpending time away from the people and places you love and care about can be very difficult. In fact, it\u2019s this very reason that a lot of nurses decide not to pursue travel nursing in the first place. However, there are certain scenarios in life that are conducive to a travel nursing career.\r\n\r\n- **You are in a stage of life with limited family and social responsibilities.** When I worked as a travel nurse, I often met nurses who were young and just starting out in life. A lot of them were single and did not yet have children, which gave them the liberty to come and go as they pleased as a travel nurse. This also allowed them to explore new parts of the country which gave them opportunities to meet new people and decide where they wanted to eventually settle down.\r\n- **You\u2019re determined to make it work. **If you do have family and friends that you cannot leave for that period of time, there is the option of choosing a travel assignment that is relatively close to home. While most hospitals have a policy that you must live a certain distance away from the facility in order to get paid for the travel reimbursement (typically 60-mile radius rule applies), that means that you can find opportunities that are just a couple hours drive away.\r\n- **You can travel together as a family.** When I took assignments as a travel nurse, it was a family affair. My husband, three-year-old child, dachshund and I went to assignments all together in our RV. In our situation, this scenario worked well in the winter months as my husband\u2019s tree service was a seasonal business.\r\n- **You can work with a friend. **A lot of travel nurses buddy up and go on assignments together. This provides more than just companionship while you\u2019re away from home, but it also provides the opportunity to earn more money because you can split the housing costs and pocket the extra stipend money.\r\n\r\n### 2. Frequent Re-Location\r\n\r\nIt can sometimes feel like you don\u2019t really have a place to call home when you are moving around a lot. This can be a benefit though too if you enjoy experiencing new places. It\u2019s a different lifestyle and at times it may feel stressful to relocate, but after a while, you might be surprised how much you get used to packing up and hitting the next scene.\r\n\r\n### 3. Lack of Seniority Advancement\r\n\r\nAs a travel nurse, you might not be able to pick up specific shifts, and you will typically float around quite a bit. It\u2019s best to go into the role knowing this and expecting such. Floating may seem frustrating, but it actually provides the opportunity to learn new skills and environments and never get bored.\r\n\r\n### 4. Paperwork for Days\r\n\r\nWith each new travel nursing assignment comes an extensive set of paperwork that needs to be completed. Once you\u2019ve taken an assignment or two and get the hang of it, you should be able to know what to expect and already have the majority of your travel nurse documents on hand ready to go. Also, keep in mind that a [good travel nursing agency](https:\/\/elitespecialtystaffing.com) will assist in completing this paperwork and do much of it on your behalf.\r\n\r\n### 5. Animosity from Staff Nurses\r\n\r\nWhile most of the staff nurses you encounter will be happy for the help and appreciative that there is extra staff around, don\u2019t be surprised if you encounter nurses who display resentful feelings toward you. Don\u2019t take it personally. These nurses know that you are making much more money than they are to do the exact same job, and to them, it can feel unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Are You Ready to Get Started in Travel Nursing?\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons of travel nursing and feel like this is a field you want to explore, there\u2019s no better time to get into this lucrative field than now.\r\n\r\nWith housing prices at all-time highs and the economy in the precarious situation it\u2019s been in since 2008, this is a great time to earn extra money as a travel nurse and have all your housing needs covered for you.\r\n\r\nAt Elite Specialty Staffing, our nurses always come first.

Speaking for myself, after I finished nursing school, it was several years before I picked up any books to read for my own enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThree years after I graduated, I had settled in nicely to a comfortable staff position at a local community hospital. As I was working full-time as a registered nurse on the night shift, I noticed a lot of nurses would keep books handy and get into reading during downtime. At the hospital I worked at, we were often not very busy at all and there were many nights where we would have several hours of downtime. I decided to pick up a book and start reading to pass the time and to help me stay awake during those long hours.\r\n\r\nThe first book I read as a nurse was \u201c[The Art of Travel](https:\/\/www.alaindebotton.com\/travel\/)\u201d by Alain de Botton. As I already had an interest in becoming a travel nurse, this piece of literature sent my dreams sailing as the author explored all the reasons why you should travel. I was hooked. Travel literature has been my favorite genre ever since. Reading other people\u2019s stories about traveling helped build my confidence and courage to one day become a travel nurse myself, which I did.\r\n\r\nWhat I discovered through my own experiences with reading is that I had tapped into a goldmine of benefits:\r\n\r\n- it\u2019s inexpensive;\r\n- it\u2019s easy to access;\r\n- it\u2019s good for the body, spirit, and mind; and\r\n- research confirms it helps establish joy and relieve stress.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reading is a Valuable Benefit for People of Any Age\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re never \u201ctoo old\u201d to reap the health benefits of picking up a good book. While a lot of studies look directly at children reading for their own success, there are also numerous health benefits for adults who read. Studies demonstrate that by keeping your brain actively engaged, you can [slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s and prevent dementia](http:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/metacognition-and-the-mind\/201804\/can-reading-help-my-brain-grow-and-prevent-dementia). Reading is a perfect way to keep your brain fully engaged.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it matters what type of content you are reading. For instance, people who read a lot of fiction have been shown to have a [greater capacity for empathy](http:\/\/www.mnn.com\/lifestyle\/arts-culture\/blogs\/why-reading-fiction-makes-you-a-better-person). The very act of reading fiction material is a mental health exercise that demonstrates the art of mindfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A Nurse\u2019s Life is Enriched and Improved Through Reading\r\n\r\nHealthcare professionals, including nurses, who read report a host of benefits it has on their lives. According to [American Nurse Today](http:\/\/www.americannursetoday.com\/mindful-nurse\/):\r\n\r\n> \u201cAmong healthcare professionals, mindfulness training can reduce psychological and physiologic stress, emotional distress, and burnout while improving empathy, job satisfaction, and sense of well-being.\u201d\r\n> \r\n> <cite>[American Nurse Today](http:\/\/www.americannursetoday.com\/mindful-nurse\/)<\/cite>\r\n\r\nSteve Wooten, a retired nurse who holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in science and nursing, has first-hand experience that echoes the reported findings. He states: \u201cYou lose yourself when you read; you\u2019re in a different world. Your imagination can really work then, as you create themes and scenarios, pictures in your mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly for a nurse, Wooten added: \u201cYour stresses and everyday life go away for a while. You can be a different person, any of the characters in the book, for the hours that you\u2019re reading.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom his own personal experience, he finds himself connecting with books written by Stephen King. His favorite title is \u201c[The Tommyknockers](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Tommyknockers)\u201c, which tells a tale of a tiny metal object that turns a small town in Maine into a death trap. About his choice of material, Wooten states:\r\n\r\n> \u201cHe\u2019s detailed enough to really get you into his world, I love it.

That brings us to possibly the best benefit of reading for nurses. Neuroscientists at Emory University proved that reading relaxes the body while improving brain function in a [2013 study](http:\/\/biomed.emory.edu\/news-events\/news-releases\/2015\/01\/berns-reading-fiction-benefits.html). Magnetic resonance imaging was used in the study in order to compare the resting-state brain activity to those who had read fiction for nine consecutive days. Positive changes in connectivity were observed after the novel reading. Sometimes this effect would last up to five days and proved the health benefits of reading. Lead researcher of the study, Dr. Gregory S. Berns told [Literacy Works](http:\/\/www.literacyworks.org\/news\/2015\/5\/20\/why-read-reason-6-knowledge-is-power-but-imagination-is-more-valuable):\r\n\r\n> \u201cAt a minimum, we can say that reading stories\u2014especially those with strong narrative arcs\u2014reconfigures brain networks for at least a few days.\u201d\u00a0\r\n> \r\n> <cite>[Literacy Works](http:\/\/www.literacyworks.org\/news\/2015\/5\/20\/why-read-reason-6-knowledge-is-power-but-imagination-is-more-valuable)<\/cite>\r\n\r\nIn another instance, he told Mother Nature Network in an interview:\r\n\r\n> \u201cEven though the participants were not actually reading the novel while they were in the scanner, they retained this heightened connectivity.

You can connect and bond with your child through sharing literature at the same time and you will have a list of highly recommended books that are going to be good.\r\n- Take a book with you for a day at the beach. Nothing quite soothes the soul like the sound of crashing waves as you lose yourself in a good book. Do this as often as you can. If you\u2019re working as a travel nurse, consider taking assignments near the ocean for this reason.\r\n- Sign up for a summer reading initiative. Libraries and online sites have different lists and reading challenges that adults can sign up for to help ignite a passion for reading.\r\n- Join a book club. Not only are book clubs a social way to build relationships and connect with people through literature, but they\u2019re also tools that can keep you more accountable for your reading exercises.\r\n\r\nWith all the health benefits of reading for nurses presented here, it would be impossible to argue that reading isn\u2019t worth the time.

Speaking for myself, after I finished nursing school, it was several years before I picked up any books to read for my own enjoyment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years after I graduated, I had settled in nicely to a comfortable staff position at a local community hospital. As I was working full-time as a registered nurse on the night shift, I noticed a lot of nurses would keep books handy and get into reading during downtime. At the hospital I worked at, we were often not very busy at all and there were many nights where we would have several hours of downtime. I decided to pick up a book and start reading to pass the time and to help me stay awake during those long hours. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first book I read as a nurse was &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.alaindebotton.com\/travel\/\">The Art of Travel<\/a>&#8221; by Alain de Botton. As I already had an interest in becoming a travel nurse, this piece of literature sent my dreams sailing as the author explored all the reasons why you should travel. I was hooked. Travel literature has been my favorite genre ever since. Reading other people&#8217;s stories about traveling helped build my confidence and courage to one day become a travel nurse myself, which I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I discovered through my own experiences with reading is that I had tapped into a goldmine of benefits: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>it&#8217;s inexpensive;<\/li><li>it&#8217;s easy to access; <\/li><li>it&#8217;s good for the body, spirit, and mind; and<\/li><li>research confirms it helps establish joy and relieve stress.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reading is a Valuable Benefit for People of Any Age<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re never &#8220;too old&#8221; to reap the health benefits of picking up a good book. While a lot of studies look directly at children reading for their own success, there are also numerous health benefits for adults who read. Studies demonstrate that by keeping your brain actively engaged, you can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/metacognition-and-the-mind\/201804\/can-reading-help-my-brain-grow-and-prevent-dementia\">slow the progression of Alzheimer&#8217;s and prevent dementia<\/a>. Reading is a perfect way to keep your brain fully engaged.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it matters what type of content you are reading. For instance, people who read a lot of fiction have been shown to have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mnn.com\/lifestyle\/arts-culture\/blogs\/why-reading-fiction-makes-you-a-better-person\">greater capacity for empathy<\/a>.
